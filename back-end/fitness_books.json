I’ve read thousands of pages\nof scientific literature and tried just about every type of workout program, diet\nregimen, and supplement you can imagine. And I can confidently say that while\nI don’t know everything, I do know what works and what doesn’t.\nLike most people, I had no clue what I was doing when I started out. I\nturned to fitness magazines for help, which told me to work out a couple of\nhours per day and spend hundreds of dollars on pills and powders per month.\nThis went on for years, and I jumped from diet to diet, workout program to\nworkout program, and supplement to supplement, only to make mediocre\nprogress and wind up in a rut.\n4 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nI then hired personal trainers for guidance, but they had me do more of\nthe same. After spending thousands of dollars, I still hadn’t gained any more\nmuscle or strength to speak of, and I still had no idea what to do with my\ndiet and training to reach my goals.

I threw the magazines\naway, fired the trainers, got off the internet forums, and searched out the\nwork of top strength and bodybuilding coaches, talked to scores of natural\nbodybuilders, and examined the scientific literature.\nSeveral months later, a clear picture was emerging.\nThe real science of getting into incredible shape is very simple—much\nsimpler than the fitness industry wants us to believe. It flies in the teeth of a\nlot of the stuff we see on Instagram and YouTube and read in books and blogs.\nHere’s the truth:\n• You don’t need supplements to build a great physique.\n• You don’t need to constantly change up your workout routine to\n“confuse” your muscles.\n• You don’t need to “eat clean” to be lean.\n• You don’t need to stop eating carbs and sugars to lose weight.\n• You don’t need to eat small meals every few hours to “boost your\nmetabolism.”\n• You don’t need to grind out hours of boring cardio every week to\nget six-pack abs.\n• You don’t need to live in the gym and sacrifice your relationships\nwith your friends and loved ones.\nBased on what I learned, I completely changed my approach to eating and\nexercising, and my body responded in ways I couldn’t believe. My strength\nskyrocketed. My muscles started growing again. My energy levels soared.\nAnd here’s the kicker: I was spending less time working out, doing less\ncardio, and eating foods I liked.\nWho Is Mike Matthews and Why Should I Care? 5\nAlong the way, my friends and family noticed how my physique was\nimproving and began asking for advice. I became their coach. I took\n“hardgainers” and put thirty pounds on them in a year. I took people who\nwere baffled why they couldn’t lose weight and stripped away piles of fat.

I\ndismissed the idea at first, but eventually, I warmed up to it. “What if I’d had\na good book as a beginner?” I thought. It would have saved me who knows\nhow much time, money, and frustration, and I would have built my best\nbody much faster. I also enjoyed helping people with what I had learned,\nand if I wrote a book and it became popular, what if I could help thousands\nor even hundreds of thousands of people?\nThat gave me a wild hair, and so I wrote Bigger Leaner Stronger and\npublished it in January 2012. It sold maybe twenty copies in the first month,\nbut within a couple of months, sales grew, and I began receiving emails\nfrom readers with high praise. I was ecstatic. I started making notes on\nhow I could improve the book based on feedback, and I outlined ideas for\nseveral other books to write.\nFast-forward to today, and I’ve now published multiple books, including\nBigger Leaner Stronger for men, Thinner Leaner Stronger for women, and\na “flexible dieting” cookbook (The Shredded Chef). Altogether, my books\nhave sold nearly two million copies, and my work has been featured in\npublications like Men’s Health, Muscle & Strength, Elle, Esquire, and more.\nMoreover, every day I get scores of emails and social media messages\nfrom thankful readers who are gobsmacked by the results they’re experi-\nencing. They’re just as shocked as I was years ago, when I first discovered\njust how straightforward and enjoyable getting fit can really be.\nThis is why I continue to write books and articles, record podcasts and\nYouTube videos, and do everything I can to be as helpful to as many people\nas I can. It’s motivating to see the impact I’m having on people’s lives, and\nI’m incredibly inspired by the dedication and determination of so many of\n6 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nmy readers and followers.

It’s a big goal, but I know\nI can do it.\nThis goes beyond merely making people look hotter, too.\nI want to make a dent in the alarming downward trends we’re seeing\nhere in the West—in particular, the decline of people’s physical and mental\nhealth and performance, which has significant and negative downstream\neffects on their family lives, careers, and personal happiness and satisfac-\ntion. Helping people to get strong and fit is a great way to counter this.\nSecond, I want to lead the fight against diet and exercise pseudoscience\nand BS.\nUnfortunately, this field is full of misinformation, disinformation, idiots,\nliars, and hucksters. I want to help change the status quo. In fact, I’d like to\nbecome the go-to guy for practical, easy-to-understand advice grounded in\nsolid science and real results.\nThird, I want to help reform the sports nutrition industry.\nThe pill and powder pushers use many scams and deceptions to foist\ntheir junk products on unwitting consumers. They use fancy-sounding-but-\nworthless ingredients; they cut their products with junk fillers like flour and\nuseless amino acids; they include tiny, ineffective doses of otherwise good\ningredients (“pixie dusting”) and hide it with the notorious “proprietary\nblend”; and they rely on fake science, overhyped-marketing claims, and\nsteroid-fueled meatheads to convince people they have the “secret sauce.”\nAnd thanks to the support of people like you from all over the world,\nI’m making inroads toward these three goals.\nSo, that’s me. From this point, it’s all going to be about you.\nI hope you enjoy this book, I hope it helps you reach your health and\nfitness goals faster, and I hope to hear from you along the way.\nMike Matthews\nVienna, Virginia\nDecember 18, 2019\nWho Is Mike Matthews and Why Should I Care? 7\nP.S.

Where do most people get diet and exercise advice?\nSocial media, TV, articles, friends, and personal trainers, right? Much of\nwhat’s learned this way is virtually useless.\nHow can I make such a bold claim?\nLet’s start with mainstream fitness magazines, websites, and books,\nwhich reach many millions of people every year. Their editors and\npublishers aren’t diabolical scum, but they have to grapple with a couple\nof dilemmas.\nThe first is this: Publications offer information and need to keep people\nbuying and subscribing. What’s the best marketing button to do this?\n“New.”\nThe easiest way to keep customers hooked is to give new advice contin-\nually—diet and training “tricks,” research “breakthroughs,” advanced\n“biohacks”—the list yammers on.\nNew information isn’t bad per se. Health and fitness are vast subjects\nwith myriad trails, tunnels, and caverns to explore. Most of it won’t sell\nbooks, magazines, or website subscriptions though. Your average guy or\ngal just wants to lose some belly fat—not learn about the nuances of training\nperiodization.\nLook at it this way. Which do you think will make a better magazine\ncover splash: “How to Understand Your Body Weight Set Point,” or “How\nto Build Bigger Biceps?”\n12 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nThis is why Men’s Health has been using the same handful of cover\nlines for years now.1 They know their target market wants, more than\nanything else, abs, bigger arms and a bigger chest, and more sex,\nmoney, confidence, intelligence, and health.

They might have titles like:\n• Fellas! How to Build 45 Pounds of Lean Muscle in Your Lifetime\n• Do More For Less—The “Secret” to Advanced Muscle Building\n• Why the Latest and Greatest Muscle-Building Supplements Do\nAbsolutely Nothing\nWhat’s more, these pieces would teach you “inconvenient truths,” like\nyou can’t gain muscle or strength like a newbie again, you can’t “recomp”\nanymore, and you can’t look like that mountain of muscle on Instagram.\nAnd that’s a horrible business plan for a publishing company.\nAs you’ll learn in this book, most of what you want to achieve with your\nbody comes down to diligent and consistent application of the basics.

Not a lifetime, but longer than some want you to believe.\nThe sooner you accept these realities, the sooner you can make real\nprogress again.\nThe second problem most publications face is the nature of their reve-\nnue: advertising.\nFor example, many of the fitness magazines you see on the shelves\nof your local bookstore are little more than mouthpieces for supplement\ncompanies, which either own the publications outright or buy the lion’s\nshare of their very pricey advertising inventory.\nWhy Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger Is Different 13\nIf these periodicals are to stay in business, they must give their spon-\nsors a strong return on investment, and they’ve gotten quite good at this.\nThey feature flashy ads that promise far more than any pill or powder\ncan deliver, cleverly written “advertorials” designed to sell products, and\nlong-form pieces on diet, nutrition, and exercise that also contain supple-\nment tie-ins.\nSo, much of what you’re “learning” in these magazines (and their online\ncounterparts) is geared toward selling you stuff"

And as long as this media keeps\nattracting eyeballs, supplement companies will keep paying, and the show\nwill go on.\nA great plan if you love convincing people to pay to be lied to.\nLet’s move on and talk trainers. As a coach and trainer myself, I hate to\nsay this, but many of my kind are a waste of money. Their hearts are often in\nthe right place, but very few have the know-how required to get beginners\ninto great shape, let alone help more experienced weightlifters take their\nfitness to the next level.\nThis is why so many people, who pay hundreds of dollars per week or\neven per hour, have so little to show for their efforts.\nYou’ve probably also noticed that many trainers aren’t even fit them-\nselves. How can they claim to be a fitness expert when they’re a skinny-fat\nweakling? Why should anyone believe them? These coaches always have\nclients, though, who almost always stay flabby, too.\nPersonal training isn’t a complete sham, though. There are many fit\ninstructors out there who know how to get results and deliver what they\npromise. If you’re one of them, I applaud you, because you’re carrying the\nweight of the entire profession on your shoulders.\nAnother popular but hit-or-miss (and miss … and miss ...) resource\npeople turn to is the internet.\nI’ve worked with thousands of people over the years, and here’s how it\nusually goes: someone finds a blog article, podcast, or social media post,\nor chats with a trainer or jacked guy or gal in an online forum, and rushes\nto use what they’ve learned.\n14 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nThe availability and accessibility of such information is great in princi-\nple—my work thrives on it—but the results depend on the information’s\naccuracy and validity.

This is why much of what you’ll learn in this book differs\nfrom what you’re used to hearing.\nI can understand if you’re skeptical. Take heart, though, because I’m\nnot going to ask you to make a big leap of faith.

That\nmeans you’ll see real, tangible improvements in your body within the first\nthree months of starting this program. Your strength and weight will move\nin the right direction, your muscles will poke through your clothes more\nthan usual, and you’ll see cuts where there were few before.

They talk about how to eat,\nexercise, supplement, and so forth, but they give little attention to the\ninner game, which is arguably more important, because simply knowing\nwhat to do is not enough. You then have to actually do it—and keep doing\nit—every day, week, month, and year.\n20 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nIf you ask me, mastering the outer game of fitness is straightforward.\nIt’s mostly just understanding how to pull the right physiological levers and\npress the right buttons to achieve your intended results and then doing\njust that.\nAcing the inner game can be much trickier, however. It’s what sets\nthe “fitness elite” apart from everyone else. Building and maintaining an\noutstanding physique requires an orderly approach to not just your diet\nand exercise, but your life.

I want to do everything I can to give\nyou your best shot at success on the Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger program.\nIn fact, if I’m being honest, I want this to be the weightlifting program\nthat finally makes all the difference and delivers the goods. Heck, maybe\neven the last regimen you ever need.\nThat’s why I want to work with you to sharpen both your inner and\nouter game and provide you with workable principles, strategies, and tools\nfor winning in not just the physical realm of fitness, but the mental and\nemotional realms as well.\nSo, in this chapter, we’ll begin our discussion of how to develop a\nsuccessful mindset that’ll empower you to overcome the obstacles, resist\nthe temptations, and surmount the setbacks that lie ahead as an interme-\ndiate or advanced weightlifter.\nThen, in the rest of this book, we’ll dig into the outer game and discover\nthe nuts and bolts of the program.\nWhat Got You Here Won’t Get You There 21\nSo, let’s start our mastery of the inner game by tackling the first hurdle\nyou must clear to get to the finish line: building better systems for achieving\nyour fitness goals.\nIn 1969, a man named Laurence J. Peter published a book on business\nmanagement called The Peter Principle.

For instance, research conducted by scientists\nfrom the Carlson School of Management, MIT Sloan School of Manage-\nment, and Yale School of Management found that high-performing sales-\npeople in 214 American businesses were more likely to be promoted to\nmanagerial roles and then fail as managers.1\nPerhaps more surprising is the fact that The Peter Principle started as\na joke. The entire book was satire. Peter’s “evidence” came from a “Hypo-\nthetical Case File” that contained named employees like Miss Oval, Mrs.\nCylinder, and Mr. Eclipse, among others.\nThe irony produced plenty of laughs, but many readers also knew that\nPeter was onto something real that was going on in businesses everywhere:\nThe higher they looked in organizations, the more incompetence they\nfound. And it turns out that Peter’s hypothesis helps explain why.\n22 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nFor my part, I think Peter’s Principle holds true in more than just busi-\nness. I believe that in life, we don’t rise to the level of our ambitions but\nto our incompetence. In other words, we can only get so far in any area,\nactivity, or endeavor with the mindset, knowledge, and skills that we have.\nMoreover, chances are those boundaries are well short of where we hope\nto arrive.

Then you stake your\nentire bankroll on your prognosis.\nYou’re dead wrong. The economy responds to the intervention and\ninflation falls while growth rises. The stock market soars and begins what’ll\nbecome a historic bull run, along with the most painful episode of your life.\nHere’s how Dalio described the downfall in his penetrating 2017\nmemoir-cum-compendium Principles:\nMy experience over this period was like a series of blows to the head\nwith a baseball bat. Being so wrong—and especially so publicly wrong—\nwas incredibly humbling and cost me just about everything I had built\nat Bridgewater. I saw that I had been an arrogant jerk who was totally\nconfident in a totally incorrect view.\nSo there I was after eight years in business, with nothing to show for\nit. Though I’d been right much more than I’d been wrong, I was all the\nway back to square one.\nWhat Got You Here Won’t Get You There 23\nAt one point, I’d lost so much money I couldn’t afford to pay the people\nwho worked with me. One by one, I had to let them go. We went down\nto two employees—Colman and me. Then Colman had to go. With tears\nfrom all, his family packed up and returned to Oklahoma.

That was not the life I wanted. On the other hand, I had a wife\nand two young children to support. I realized I was facing one of life’s\nbig turning points and my choices would have big implications for me\nand for my family’s future.\nDalio didn’t merely “rise to the level of his incompetence”—he loaded\nhimself into a cannon, pointed it to the sky, and blasted himself into smithereens.\nWhat do you think you’d do if you were in his shoes? Would you\nknuckle under?\nDalio refused to give up. Instead, he turned the catastrophe into an\ninvaluable learning experience by setting out to discover why his systems\nfailed him and how to fix them for another run at the markets.\nI won’t spoil the entire story here (read his book!), but this process led\nto the development of a revolutionary new investment strategy, or system,\nthat would catapult Dalio to greater success than ever before and set the\ntrajectory for the rest of his life.\nThree key lessons we can learn from Dalio’s experiences:\n1. No matter who we are, the Peter Principle can strike any of us down.\n2. We should give just as much attention to our level of incompetence\nas our goals.\n3. The better our systems, the higher we can rise before reaching\nour limits.\n24 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nWe can also observe that the greater the goal, the more robust the\nsystem must be for achieving it.

No matter how beautifully we populate the landscapes of our futures\nwith lush dreams and desires, only equally magnificent systems can bridge\nthe chasm between what is and what could be.\nMaybe your goal is to build a successful business. Your system would\ninvolve how you create and sell products and services, recruit and keep\nemployees, and use and manage finances.\nOr maybe your goal is to learn a new language. Your system would\ninvolve how often you practice, how you grow your vocabulary, and how\nyou learn grammar.\nIf your goal is to increase your powerlifting numbers by fifty pounds,\nyour system would involve the way you eat, train, recover, and supplement.\nThe power of systems, especially in athletics, can’t be denied. A textbook\nexample is the story of the legendary college basketball coach John Wooden,\nwho won ten NCAA Championships in twelve years and went on an unprec-\nedented sixty-one-game winning streak.\nWhat many fans don’t know, however, is that Wooden coached his\nBruins for fifteen years before securing his first championship. During\nthis time, he worked in relative obscurity to assemble his system piece by\npiece, from recruiting the right players to developing his coaching method\nand philosophy, to advancing the full-court-press style of play. No one quite\nunderstood or appreciated what Wooden was doing until, “suddenly,” the\nhumble coach and his team started trouncing every competitor.\nSo my point is this: While formulating goals is an important aspect of\nsuccessful living, effective systems are what produce achievements. And too\nmany people focus too much on ideation and too little on systematization.\nHow do we build better systems, though?

Examples are the food in your pantry, the\npeople in a town, the nutrients in a plant, the money in your bank account,\nand your happiness.\nInteractions (interconnections) can be harder to spot and learn about,\nbut are entities that make stocks increase or decrease, like a faucet or drain\nthat changes the stock of water in a bathtub. This movement of material is\nknown as a flow.\nIn many cases, flows involve the transfer of information, like the\nconcepts you’re learning through my use of the system of language, but\nthey can also involve physical flows, such as the blood moving through\nyour veins.\nWhen viewed this way, a basketball team is a system. Its elements\ninclude players, coaches, a court, and a ball; its interconnections include\nthe game’s rules, the coaching strategies, the communication between\nplayers—even the laws of physics that govern how the ball and players\nmove; and its purpose can vary by team and player, including winning\ngames, having fun, making money, or all or none of these and something\nelse altogether.\nDiet and exercise regimens are systems for muscle, strength, and vital-\nity. Their elements include calories, macronutrients, intensity, volume, and\nfrequency; their interconnections include dietary and training strategies\nand techniques and the principles they’re based on like energy balance,\nmacronutrient balance, and progressive overload; and a common purpose\nis safely and healthily enhancing body composition and well-being.\n26 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nSo, that’s a system, and how it relates to fitness.\nThe next question to answer is: how do we make better systems?\nTwo of my favorite methods are quantification and ritualization.

        "text": " answer is: how do we make better systems?\nTwo of my favorite methods are quantification and ritualization. Quan-\ntification refers to measuring and paying attention to things that are import-\nant, and ritualization to developing and maintaining the right habits.\nLet’s review each in more detail.\nQuantification and the Power of Counting\nIn his bestselling 2008 book Better: A Surgeon’s Notes on Performance,\nAtul Gawande wrote the following:\nCount something. Regardless of what one ultimately does in medi-\ncine—or outside of medicine, for that matter—one should be a scien-\ntist in this world. In the simplest terms, this means one should count\nsomething. …It doesn’t really matter what you count. You don’t need\na research grant. The only requirement is that what you count should\nbe interesting to you.\nCounting is crucial, because it’s a powerful way to determine whether\na system is fulfilling its stated purpose.\nIf your goal is to gain muscle and strength, and you don’t record your\nworkouts or body measurements, you won’t have the raw data required to\nknow with certainty whether your diet and exercise systems are working.\nYou might have intuitions or educated guesses, but these can be faulty\nand uncertain, which can sap your motivation and will to continue dieting\nand training.\nBy quantifying and tracking at least one thing that’s important, however,\nyou’re installing in your system what’s known as a feedback loop, which is\na significant component of all complex systems.\nA feedback loop is formed when the change in a stock of a system affects\nthe flows into or out of that same stock. In other words, it’s a mechanism\nWhat Got You Here Won’t Get You There 27\nwhereby an output can “loop” back to and affect the thing that produced it.\nWhen you assess the balance of your bank account (stock), if you feel\nthe level is too low, you may adjust your work hours upward to bring in\nmore cash (flow in) or curtail spending (flow out) or both. On the other\nhand, if you’re feeling flush, you may work less, earn less, spend more, or\nall three. Without such an assessment, however, you might change nothing\nin the system until outside factors come into play, like bouncing a check\nor wanting to make a large purchase, like a home."

Without such an assessment, however, you might change nothing\nin the system until outside factors come into play, like bouncing a check\nor wanting to make a large purchase, like a home. Thus, a simple bank\nstatement can help form a feedback loop.\nSimilarly, by tracking your workouts and body measurements, you can\nassess the changes occurring in your whole-body strength and muscle\n(stocks) and know whether your system needs upgrading. If you’re not\nsure how to do this properly, refer to the chapter in Bigger Leaner Stronger\ntitled “The Right and Wrong Ways to Track Your Progress.”\nThe same goes for any goal and system. A cardinal rule of good systems\nis you should always track something, and ideally, the thing that best\nmeasures the fulfillment of the function or purpose.\nThis can be difficult, because what matters most sometimes isn’t easy\nto quantify. If the purpose of a system is to increase your happiness, that’s\nharder to measure than let’s say, improving your golf game.\nThat doesn’t mean it can’t be done, however. For example, “The Oxford\nHappiness Questionnaire” is a comprehensive and evidence-based quiz that\ncan help you quantify your subjective sense of wellbeing. As of this writing,\nyou can take it online for free.\nWhatever you do, don’t fall into the trap of setting goals around things\nthat are easy to measure instead of important. Our culture is obsessed with\nnumbers and pays the most attention to whatever can be clearly defined and\ncounted, and it disregards what can’t, like qualitative aspects. Sometimes\nquality should be the focus, though, not quantity.\n28 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nRitualization and the Power of Habit\nIf you review the most common New Year’s resolutions of the last decade,\nyou’ll find most people are struggling with the same things.\nYear after year, millions of people resolve to improve their health (eat\nbetter, lose weight, exercise more), save more money, and read more, only\nto fall well short of the mark again and again.\nWhen viewed through the lens of systems theory, none of these goals\nshould strike us as particularly complex undertakings.

Moreover, thanks\nto the staggering amount of high-quality information available on how to\ndo any of these things, they require little in the way of creativity, either. So\nwhy are these ambitions so thorny?\nOne primary reason is the systems that produce them usually demand\nmajor deviations from habitual behavior patterns. And all of us know how\ndifficult it can be to stop doing the things we shouldn’t be doing and start\ndoing the things we should.\nThe new routines (systems) require such large changes that they\noften lack resilience, or the ability to survive or persist in an ever-changing\nenvironment.\nIt can take a tremendous amount of thrust to escape the gravity well\nof what’s familiar, and once we have, it can be easy to fall back into it due\nto stress, temptation, or malaise. Thus, the better we can ingrain the right\nhabits and avoid the wrong ones, the better our systems will operate.\nHere’s how Charles Duhigg explains it in his blockbuster 2012 book\nThe Power of Habit:\nHabits are powerful, but delicate. They can emerge outside our\nconsciousness or from deliberate action. Habits often occur without\nour permission, but can be reshaped by fiddling with their parts. They\nshape our lives far more than we realize—they are so strong, in fact,\nthat they cause our brains to cling to them desperately.\nIndeed, according to research conducted by scientists at Duke\nWhat Got You Here Won’t Get You There 29\nUniversity, habits dictate as much as 40 percent of our daily actions.\nBiologically, this makes sense. By “habitualizing” activities, our brain can\nconserve energy and perform common tasks more efficiently.\nSo, how can we get better at wielding the power of habit and increase\nthe resilience of our systems for positive change? The following three\nstrategies can help:\n1. Start easy and small\n2. Improve gradually\n3. Expect failure\nLet’s discuss each.\n1. Start Easy and Small\nFor building and breaking habits, consistency is the name of the game.\nThe more often you do or don’t do things, the easier it becomes to continue\ndoing or not doing them.\nTherefore, you should avoid overreaching when you begin any new\nendeavor.

Instead, start with something so easy and small you can’t say no.\nWant to get more and better sleep? Start with going to bed fifteen\nminutes earlier than usual each night. Want to eat a healthier diet? Start\nwith eating one additional healthy meal per week. Want to increase your\nnet worth? Start with saving just 1 percent more of your income each week.\nRemember in the beginning, the goal is getting in motion, not a radical\ntransformation. That comes later, through consistent and enduring effort.\n2. Improve Gradually\nOnce an easy, simple habit has taken root, you can enhance it by adding\ndifficulty or complexity.\n30 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nDon’t try to do too much too fast, though, lest you trip yourself up.\nBe patient and strive for small, incremental improvements that in and of\nthemselves seem almost trivial, but that can amount to significant changes\nover time.\nThink of it this way: If you were to improve something, anything, by\njust 1 percent per day for a year, it would be nearly 38 times better than\nwhen you started. Just 1 percent better per day for a month yields a 135\npercent improvement. This is the power of compound interest applied to\nour lives and explains why making regular small refinements to our habits\nis a surefire path to stellar outcomes.\nLet’s take another look at the habit of going to bed fifteen minutes\nearlier mentioned above. Once that’s on automatic, you could increase the\ndifficulty and complexity by pushing your bedtime forward another fifteen\nminutes and ending screen exposure fifteen minutes earlier than usual.\nBy repeating this process of acclimating to conditions and then adding\ndifficulty or complexity, you can put a powerful system in place for being\nwell rested.\nFor the purpose of eating a healthier diet, you could increase the\nnumber of healthy meals per week, have fewer servings of sugar, start\ntaking a high-quality multivitamin supplement, and so on.\nAnd as for increasing your net worth, you could start diverting some\nof your savings to a retirement account and then raise contributions.

Instead, most wins are the natural and inevitable result of the slow\nand steady accumulation of marginal progress—the raindrops that trickle\ninto the reservoir until it overflows.\nWhat Got You Here Won’t Get You There 31\n3. Expect Failure\nDan John, an author and record-holding strength and condition-\ning coach, often tells his new athletes they’re “not good enough to be\ndisappointed.”\nThis goes for anyone starting anything new and challenging. What\nis there to be disappointed about? That we didn’t experience immediate\nbreakthroughs? That we made the same mistakes as everyone else?\nInstead of expecting perfection and scolding ourselves as soft, stupid,\nor unskilled when we can’t live up to that standard, we should cut ourselves\nsome slack and focus our energies on getting back on target again.\nWe haven’t earned the right to be disappointed yet, so why jump the gun?\nThe fact is failing in an attempt doesn’t make us a failure. It makes us\nnormal. Every system has its flaws and challenges. What matters more is\nhow you rebound and resume normalcy.\nIf you’re reading this book, I think it’s fair to assume that you want to get\nbetter, and not just in the gym.\nYou probably also realize you must change your life to improve—that\ndoing the same things you’ve been doing won’t get you to where you want\nto be.\nThis requires you to be more than a good worker—you must be a good\ndesigner as well.

As it happens, the extraordinary discrepancies stemmed\nfrom the most ordinary of things: the forms used to recruit donors.\nIn the low-donation countries, the forms contained this line: “If you want\nto be an organ donor, check here.” In other words, you had to volunteer\nfor the program. In the high-donation countries, however, the forms read\nlike this: “If you don’t want to be an organ donor, check here.” That is, you\nhad to decline the program.\nThink about that for a second. The way you’re asked a question can\ndictate your decision on something as personal as what to do with your body\nwhen you die. Imagine how much time, money, and effort politicians might\nspend trying to increase organ donation rates with education, incentives, or\neven coercion, when all they need to do to reach nearly perfect compliance\nis change a single line of text in a humdrum government form.\nThe researchers of that paper concluded the following about human\npsychology, which also applies to how our environments inform our lives:\n“In most cases, the majority of people choose the default option to"

If a box on a\nform is unchecked, we’ll leave it unchecked. If cars are lining up in a lane\non the highway, we’ll join them. If we display fruit in our kitchen instead of\njunk food, we’ll eat more fruit.\nThis isn’t shocking, but what came as a surprise to me is just how many\naspects of our lives run on near autopilot, guided by the scores of cues\nprovided by our environment.\nFor instance, studies show that high-priced entrées on restaurant\nmenus lure us into ordering more expensive items.2 At the supermarket,\nwe’re more likely to buy things at eye level, and showing men pictures\nof bikini-clad women makes them act more impulsively.3 People who are\ndieting will skip a “milkshake” on a menu and turn down “candy chews”\nin the checkout aisle, but have no qualms about drinking a “smoothie” or\neating “fruit chews.”4\nCurious, isn’t it? Also surprising is how many elements of our environ-\nment have been carefully and scientifically engineered to elicit desired\nresponses—responses that rarely benefit us.\nIn their bestselling 2009 book Nudge, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein\nreferred to this as “choice architecture,” and they believe powerful organi-\nzations like corporations and governments can—and should—help create\nenvironments that incline us toward personally and socially responsible\nbehaviors. A “soft paternalism,” if you will.\nI say, why wait for someone else to do it? Why not design our own\nenvironments as a personal project, so they nudge us toward the specific\noutcomes we desire?

What simple changes could\nyou make to your environment to make this easier?\nHere are some ideas …\n• Put your walking shoes and headphones in front of your bedroom\ndoor or in your car, so you see them when it comes time to walk\n(early morning or after work, for instance).\n• Find a podcast or audiobook so you have something else to look\nforward to while walking.\n38 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\n• Go straight to the park after work and do your walk before going\nhome.\nAny of these things could help make the habit stick and become an\nautomatic, integrated part of your life.\nLet’s look at eating less at dinner. You could …\nPlate your meal and pack away the leftovers in the fridge before you eat.\nTake your dog on a walk after eating the amount of food you intend to eat.\nBrush your teeth after eating the intended amount.\nThese would work well because they make it harder or impossible to\nkeep eating.\nAnd for morning workout punctuality, you could …\n• Go to bed thirty minutes earlier than usual, so you have an easier\ntime waking up in the morning.\n• Prepare your pre-workout meal the night before, so all you have to\ndo in the morning is eat it and head to the gym.\n• Set two alarms so you can snooze one and still get up in time to\nwork out.\nThese things may seem trivial, but don’t discount their effectiveness.

Sometimes, something very\nminor like setting out your workout clothes can be the difference between\ngetting out of bed and into the gym, or sleeping another hour or two.\nAnother example: Many people want to drink less caffeine and more\nwater.

The benefits of\njoy appear in the Bible, which states in Proverbs 17:22, “a cheerful heart\nis good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.” Ancient Greek\nphysicians prescribed visits to comedy shows to help patients heal faster.\nEarly Native Americans used laughter as an adjunct to various types of\ntreatment and therapy.\nIn later times, doctors found that humor could distract from the pain of\nsurgery, promote recovery, and treat depression as well as other psychi-\natric disorders.\nHumor wasn’t considered a legitimate field of scientific study, however,\nuntil 1964, when Dr. William F.

And chances are\nyou’d end up enjoying your food and feeling content with your selection.\n54 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nIf, however, you’d analyze the possibilities from many angles in hopes\nof finding the “best” one, you’d be pursuing the strategy of maximizing. And\nchances are you’d end up dissatisfied with the meal and irked you didn’t\nspend more time investigating the alternatives.\nThis holds true for all decisions you make. The more you satisfice (go\nfor good enough), the more likely you are to enjoy what you get and the\nmore you maximize (seek and accept only the best), the more prone you\nare to disappointment.\nHere’s a silly example you can probably relate to: When my wife Sarah\nand I would sit down to watch TV, I’d suck her into a tedious weighing of\noptions to find the “best” choice. We watch little TV, so we should try to\nmake the most of the time, right?\nI’d check a site or two online to see what’s new and popular, skim\nreviews, canvass Sarah, and hem and haw. This didn’t make for a pleasant\nwind down. Either I’d lose interest in watching TV altogether, and get “the\nlook,” or end up dissatisfied with our pick, wondering if another would’ve\nbeen better.\nI’ve since changed my tack.

If it doesn’t, oh well, we’ll try again next\ntime.

Here’s how psychologist Barry Schwartz\nexplained the problem of maximizing in his excellent 2009 book The Para-\ndox of Choice:\nWhy a “Good Enough” Diet Is No Longer Good Enough 55\nMaximizers need to be assured that every purchase or decision was\nthe best that could be made. Yet how can anyone truly know that any\ngiven option is absolutely the best possible? The only way to know is\nto check out all the alternatives. A maximizer can’t be certain that she\nhas found the best sweater unless she’s looked at all the sweaters. She\ncan’t know that she is getting the best price unless she’s checked out\nall the prices. As a decision strategy, maximizing creates a daunting\ntask, which becomes all the more daunting as the number of options\nincreases.\n…\nIf you’re a satisficer, the number of available options need not have a\nsignificant impact on your decision making. When you examine an\nobject and it’s good enough to meet your standards, you look no further;\nthus, the countless other available choices become irrelevant. But if\nyou’re a maximizer, every option has the potential to snare you into\nendless tangles of anxiety, regret, and second-guessing.\n…\nWhereas maximizers might do better objectively than satisficers, they\ntend to do worse subjectively. Imagine a maximizer who succeeds in\nbuying a sweater after an extensive search—a better sweater than any\nbut the luckiest satisficer would end up with. How does he feel about the\nsweater? Is he frustrated at how much time and work went into buying\nit? Is he imagining unexamined alternatives that might be better? Is he\nasking himself whether friends of his might have gotten better deals?\nIs he scrutinizing every person he passes in the street to see if they’re\nwearing sweaters that look finer? The maximizer might be plagued by\nany or all of these doubts and concerns while the satisficer marches\non in warmth and comfort.\n…\nGetting the best objective result may not be worth much if we feel\ndisappointed with it anyway.\nIn other"

A good enough cup of\ncoffee, a good enough bagel, a good enough pair of jeans.\nUnless it’s not. Some decisions are important enough to warrant delib-\neration, like whether to go to college or trade school, who to marry, and\nwhere to work. Sometimes, the opportunity cost of maximizing—in time,\neffort, money, and stress—can be well worth it in the long run.\nKnowing when to satisfice or maximize, then, is a vital skill to develop\nif we want to not only experience better outcomes but be more satisfied\nwith them. Because while maximizing produces better results, they may\nnot be worth much if we feel disappointed with them, anyway.\nNow, you might be thinking, “This is neat and all, but what does it have\nto do with getting jacked?”\nWhile the “good enough” method of loosely planning and tracking your\ncalories and macros (satisficing) can work fine as a beginner, it becomes\na recipe for stagnation as you continue training. How you approach your\ndiet as an intermediate weightlifter is a more important decision than many\npeople realize. Eventually, you need to shift to the maximizing mindset.\nThe reason? Your body has several balancing feedback loops that limit\nmuscle growth, and the primary dietary ones relate to calorie, protein, and\ncarbohydrate intake, in that order.\nThe physiological mechanisms impacted by these nutritional factors\nare covered in detail in Bigger Leaner Stronger, so I won’t rehash them here.\nThey don’t change as you accumulate training experience, either, but how\nthey affect your body does.\nOnce your “newbie gains” are well behind you, and you’re in a lean\nbulking phase, even short but regular periods of insufficient"

And when you’re in a cutting phase, restricting your calories too\nWhy a “Good Enough” Diet Is No Longer Good Enough 57\naggressively and eating too little protein can lead to significant muscle loss.\nTherefore, you need to keep a much closer eye on your calories and\nmacros as an intermediate weightlifter.\nFor instance, when you’re hoping to maximize muscle gain, you need\nto maintain a calorie surplus and eat enough protein every day. When\nyou want to minimize fat gain, however, you also need to ensure that your\ncalorie surplus is not too large. And when you want to maximize fat loss\nand retain muscle, you need a substantial (but not reckless) calorie deficit\nand plenty of protein.\nWhether you accomplish these things through meal planning or on-the-\nfly tracking, intuitive eating, or some other system, the method isn’t import-\nant. We’ll talk more about viable options in the next chapter, but you’ll need\nto find what works for you.\nThis can require major adjustments for many people as they move from\ntheir beginner (first year or so) to intermediate phases.\nOften, beginners have gotten used to paying little attention to their\ncalories or macros, while still enjoying consistent results.

Take zinc, which is one of the most commonly reported\nnutrient deficiencies among bodybuilders and is required in adequate\namounts for optimal thyroid function.1 As the thyroid hormone influences\nmetabolic rate, when levels drop, weight loss can slow.2\nA good example of this comes from a case study conducted by scien-\ntists at the University of Massachusetts.3 Researchers took two zinc-defi-\ncient college women and gave them 26 milligrams of zinc per day for four\nmonths. They also took careful measurements of the women’s resting\nmetabolic rate (RMR), as well as zinc and thyroid hormone levels at the\nbeginning of the study, and then again after two and four month periods\nof supplementing daily.\nBy the end of the study,"

On the other hand, a slice of white bread\nwith processed cheese has a TEF of only 11 percent, so 200 of these calories\nonly “cost” about 20 to process.5\nWhile a difference of 20 calories in a single meal is insignificant, it can\nadd up meal after meal, day after day.\nIf you’re getting, let’s say, half of your calories from highly processed,\nlow-TEF foods, you might burn several hundred more calories per day by\nswapping most of them for less processed foods.\nThe bottom line is it’s easier to lose fat and gain muscle if you mostly\neat whole, nutritious, less processed foods, and this is particularly true for\nintermediate weightlifters who want to keep gaining muscle and strength.\nSo then, if a “good enough” diet is no longer good enough as an intermedi-\nate or advanced weightlifter and it’s time to strive for the “best,” what does\nthat look like?\nFortunately, the answer isn’t what most people do—fad diets"

While it’s great for staying lean\nwithout having to crunch numbers, it’s not well suited to building your ideal\nphysique. Meal planning is far better for this.\nTo understand why, let’s talk about intuitive eating, because, despite\nwhat many people think, it’s not eating whatever you want whenever you\nwant. That’s more like “anarchic” eating, which will result in weight gain\nand other non-optimum health conditions.\nIntuitive eating is a system of controlling what you eat based on your\nbody’s internal cues, rather than meal plans or other external means. It’s a\nscientific term, and we can summarize it in three precepts:5\n1. Eat when you’re hungry.\n2. Stop eating when you’re full.\n3. Don’t restrict your food choices (except for medical reasons).\nIt sounds simple enough, but it’s also easier said than done for most\npeople. For instance, studies show that many people eat a sizable portion\nof their daily calories for reasons other than hunger.6 Boredom, procrasti-\nnation, peer-pressure, hedonism, and convenience are all common triggers\n68 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nthat sway us to eat more than we should and often food we don’t even want.\nAs you well know, meal planning and calorie counting are effective\ncountermeasures for dealing with these temptations to overeat.\nA good example of this is a study that found that intuitive eating helped\npeople lose weight just as fast as calorie counting at first.7 Eventually"

It’s tricky to eat our true calorie needs, because it’s easy to think\nwe’re eating only to satisfy our hunger when that’s not the case.8\nWe’re highly susceptible to small triggers in our environment that\nencourage overeating. Take portion sizes, for example. A study\nconducted by scientists at the University of Technology Sydney\nfound that for every doubling of portion sizes, most people subcon-\nsciously ate about 35 percent more.9 That is, if someone serves them-\nselves two cups of macaroni instead of one, they’ll likely eat more.\nOther research shows that eating from bigger packages and plates\ncan result in eating more calories.10 Our hunger levels are influ-\nenced by what we see. Even when we know we’ve eaten enough, if\nsomeone shows up with a plate of fresh-baked cookies, our brain\ncan shift back to “hungry.”11\nAnother potent trigger for overeating is food variety. Scientists have\nknown for decades that giving people more food choices, espe-\ncially when those foods are tasty and calorie dense, can encourage\novereating.12\nWe can only handle so much of the same flavor, texture, smell, etc.\nbefore we get bored with it and stop eating, so food companies\npresent us with a cornucopia of chow that has been painstakingly\nThe Almost Nearly Perfect Diet 69\nengineered to look, smell, and taste delightful.\nFaced with this abundance, it’s all too easy to turn into Augustus\nGloop from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, gobbling up\none goody after another.13\n2. The more weight we lose, the more our body becomes resistant to\nfurther weight loss.14\nThis is because of various physiological mechanisms known as\n“metabolic adaptation” that work to increase our energy intake\nand decrease our energy expenditure.

The main mechanism at\nplay here is hunger, which rises as you lose weight, making it more\ndifficult to maintain a calorie deficit when “eating by feel.”15\nIntuitive eating doesn’t work well for gaining weight, either, because\nthis requires eating more food than you want to. You don’t have to drink a\ngallon of milk per day (in fact, don’t do that), but there’s truth in the body-\nbuilding adage that you have to “eat big to get big.”\nThat’s easy to do. For a bit. In time, however, your calorie intake will\ncreep downward without you even realizing it, and so will your progress\nin the gym. That’s just how the appetite works. Your body doesn’t want to\novereat for long periods of time.16\nYet another drawback to intuitive eating is it makes it hard to get your\nmacros right. You must be a skilled “flexible dieter” to wing it and get\nenough protein every day, let alone optimal amounts of carbs and fats, too.\nAll this is why intuitive eating is best for maintaining your body compo-\nsition and not transforming it. That is, when you’re more or less happy with\nyour physique and aren’t striving to get bigger, leaner, or stronger, you can\ndo well with intuitive eating.

You feel special.\nIt’s hard to give all that up for glacial changes in your physique, espe-\ncially when the chirpy devil on your shoulder reminds you of it every chance\nhe gets. “Wouldn’t it be nice to have that six-pack again?

This prevents your body fat from ever going too high,\nwhich is aesthetically pleasing, and eliminates the need for longer cutting\nphases, which can be draining.\nAs you might have guessed, a mini-cut is a shorter-than-usual cut,\nnormally between three and four weeks.

You can just maintain a steady\nsurplus until reaching the body fat “ceiling” of 15 to 17 percent and then\nbegin a cutting phase, but there are two downsides to this approach:\n1. As you get deeper into your lean bulk, you’ll probably become more\nuncomfortable with your body fat levels.\n2. Once it comes time to cut, you’ll have a rather long journey back\nto lean ahead of you.\nThis is why many people find that mini-cuts make lean bulking more\nenjoyable. They help keep your body fat in a more attractive range and\nminimize the time you have to spend in an ongoing calorie deficit.\nFor instance, let’s say you’re a 190-pound guy at 10 percent body fat, and\nyou’re starting a lean bulk phase. As a natural intermediate or advanced\nweightlifter, you should look to gain around 0.25 to 0.5 percent of your body\nweight per month while lean bulking, and if you have ordinary muscle\nbuilding genetics, about half of that weight should be lean mass and half fat.\nThat means that on average, you should gain 0.5 to 1 pound per month,\nconsisting of 0.25 to 0.5 pounds of lean mass and fat per month.\nMany people gain weight faster than this while lean bulking, because\nthey overeat too often (vacations, holidays, accidents, and so forth), but\nlet’s say you execute your gaining phase flawlessly.

What it isn’t, however, is\nthe quantum leap in dieting that some people would have you believe. It won’t\nautomagically help you “recomp,” burn away belly fat, or stave off aging.\nIt can, however, help you stick to your diet better and improve your\nlong-term results. That’s why you should understand what it is, how it\nworks, and how to use it.\nTo get there, let’s start at square one: why is it called “intermittent\nfasting”?\nWell, the term is only a semi-perfect description of what it is. You fast,\nbut depending on the protocol, not necessarily “intermittently”—some-\ntimes, you do the opposite and fast on a regular schedule.\nAnd what is “fasting?” Many people assume it means “not eating food”\nor “having an empty stomach,” but it’s more than that.\nWhen you eat food, it gets broken down into various molecules that\nyour cells can use, like amino acids, glucose, and fatty acids. These mole-\ncules find their way into your blood and are met by the hormone insulin,\nwhich shuttles them into cells.\nInsulin levels rise in proportion to the size and composition of the\nmeal. The larger the meal and higher in protein and carbohydrate it is, the\nlarger the insulin response.17 The size and composition of the meal also\ndetermines how long insulin levels remain elevated (anywhere from two\nto six+ hours).18\nWhen your body is digesting and absorbing the food you’ve eaten, and\ninsulin levels are “up,” you’re in a “fed” or “postprandial” state (prandial\nmeans having to do with a meal). Once your body has finished processing\nthe food and nutrients, however, insulin levels drop to a low, baseline level,\nand you’re now in a “fasted” or “postabsorptive” state.\nThe Almost Nearly Perfect Diet 77\nAs intermittent fasting is a style of dieting that concerns itself most\nwith when instead of what you eat, the general goal is to"

For instance, with the\nprotocol I recommend, you eat food intermittently for 8 hours and eat\nnothing for 16 hours. This way, your body spends more time in a postab-\nsorptive state.\nWhy all the emphasis on fasting? This is why I was skeptical. One of\nthe easiest ways to invent a fad diet is to isolate some aspect of eating and\nhang everything else on it.\nFor example, low-carb crusaders hold up carbs as the gateway drug to\nobesity, disease, racism, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and everything\nelse wrong in the world. Paleo advocates claim that our dietary habits\nshould follow a flawed understanding of what our ancient ancestors ate.\nGluten-free muppets bang on about how a protein harmless to the vast\nmajority of the population is destroying our bodies and must be stamped\nout of existence.\nThen there’s intermittent fasting, which puts fasting up on a pedestal.\nHence my early cynicism.\nAnd I wasn’t entirely wrong. The health and body composition benefits\nof intermittent fasting are wildly overblown, and many claims (reduced acne,\nincreased longevity, and others) are essentially made up out of whole cloth.\nThat said, if you have a hard time sticking to your diet with a traditional\neating pattern, intermittent fasting may be able to help.19 For instance, the\nsingle biggest hurdle we face when cutting is controlling calorie intake, and\nif intermittent fasting makes that even slightly easier, it’s worth"

Group one ate all of their calories in a four-hour window, four days\nper week. They could eat whatever and as much as they wanted,\nbut couldn’t eat outside of those four hours on those days, and on\nthe other days, they could eat whenever they wanted.\n2.

Glycogen stored in the liver. Glycogen is a form of carbohydrate\nthat can be converted into glucose.\n2. Body fat. When fat cells are mobilized, fatty acids are released into\nthe blood, which many of your cells can burn for energy, along with\nglycerol, which can be converted into glucose.\nSo long as the body can turn to these two energy sources to sustain\nitself, it has no reason to break down muscle tissue. When the liver runs out\nof glycogen, however, the body won’t continue burning body fat alone—it’ll\nalso cannibalize muscle to obtain amino acids for conversion into glucose.\nFor example, a research review conducted by Dr. George F. Cahill, Jr.\nfound that amino acids produced by the breakdown of muscle tissue were\nresponsible for about 50 percent of glucose maintenance at the 16-hour\nmark of fasting, and 100 percent at the 28-hour mark.26\nFor this reason, many intermittent fasting protocols designed for\nathletes and bodybuilders don’t involve fasting for over 16 hours at a time.\nThe other fable intermittent fasting has dispelled is the claim that it can\ncause your metabolism to faceplant.\nMost people connect hunger and starvation (“I’m starving,” they say,\njust a few hours after their last meal), but physiologically, these are very\ndifferent things. Hunger is a spark, while starvation is a four-alarm fire.\nAnd it takes a lot of hunger to turn into real starvation.\nCase in point: a study conducted by scientists at the University of Roch-\nester found that metabolic rate didn’t decline until 60 hours of fasting, and\nthe reduction was a mere 8 percent.27\nWhat’s more, research shows that the metabolism speeds up after 36 to\n48 hours of fasting, which makes sense from an evolutionary perspective.28\nIf we haven’t eaten in some time, what does our body want?

By increasing production\nThe Almost Nearly Perfect Diet 81\nof two chemicals that sharpen our minds and urge us to move around:\nadrenaline and noradrenaline. Incidentally, these chemicals also increase\nour metabolic rate.\nStudies show that true “starvation” begins at about three days (72\nhours) of not eating, at which point the primary source of energy becomes\nmuscle tissue.29 This causes muscle loss, but even that tapers off as time\ngoes on, because lean mass is vital to preserving health and life.30\nSo, here’s the bottom line:\nLike any popular brand of dieting, intermittent fasting is a victim of\nunreal hopes and expectations. People will always hunt for shortcuts and\n“hacks,” and there’ll always be astute marketers ready to oblige them.\nIt would be great if manipulating your eating schedule alone could\nsignificantly improve muscle gain, fat loss, and health, but it can’t. Only a\nlifestyle that includes regular exercise, nutritious foods, minimal alcohol,\nand good sleep hygiene can move the needle in a major way.\nWhat intermittent fasting can do, though, is make eating fewer calories\neasier and more enjoyable. That’s it.\nCalorie Cycling\nCalorie cycling is a method of eating that involves planned increases and\ndecreases in calorie intake, usually by eating more or less carbohydrate.\nThere are many calorie cycling protocols to choose from, but most alter-\nnate between high-, medium-, and low-calorie days throughout the week.\n• On high-calorie days, you typically consume more calories than\nyou burn.\n• On medium-calorie days, you typically consume as many calories\nas you burn.\n• On low-calorie days, you typically consume fewer calories than\nyou burn.\n82 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nThe exact mix of your high-, medium-, and low-calorie days depends\non your goals and preferences.\nFor example, if you want to lose fat, you could maintain a calorie deficit\nfor five days per week, and eat at maintenance on the remaining two days\nto give your body a break.

As an advanced weightlifter, this can help with\nmuscle retention as you get leaner, especially if you’re dieting to very low\nlevels of body fat.\nIf you want to gain muscle and strength while minimizing fat gain, you\ncan flip this layout around and maintain a slight calorie surplus five days\nper week, and eat at maintenance or even a deficit on the remaining two\ndays of the week.\nProponents of calorie cycling claim it’s superior to traditional dieting\nin several meaningful ways, including faster fat loss and muscle gain and\nfewer unwanted side effects when cutting and lean bulking.\nUnfortunately, it’s not that cut-and-dried. Calorie cycling is a minor\nimprovement over the norm for some people under some circumstances,\nbut definitely not a breakthrough in diet and nutrition.\nLet’s start by looking at how calorie cycling affects weight loss, which\nis its most powerful draw.\nCalorie Cycling and Weight Loss\nAs you know, any diet that has you maintain a calorie deficit over\nan extended period will cause weight loss, regardless of when and how\nyou consume those calories. According to some people, calorie cycling\naugments calorie restriction by boosting your metabolism and fat burning,\nresulting in more fat loss.\nThis is hogwash.\nTo understand why, you first have to understand what happens at a\ncellular level when you lose fat.\nWhen you restrict your calories for fat loss, several chemical, hormonal,\nand metabolic changes take place in your body. Chief among these\nThe Almost Nearly Perfect Diet 83\nfluctuations is a drop in a hormone produced by body fat known as leptin.31\nThis drop in leptin underlies the constellation of side effects associated\nwith dieting known as metabolic adaptation, or more inaccurately, metabolic\ndamage.32\nLeptin plays an important role in many bodily functions, but its main job\nis to keep the brain alert to how much energy is available for survival. The\nbrain pays close attention to the relationship between the energy burned\nthrough basic metabolic function and activity and the calories available\nfrom food and body fat.\nIn the short-term (hours, days), leptin rises and falls based on your\ndaily calorie intake (especially your carb"

In the early stages of diet-\ning—the first three to five weeks for most people—it’s duck soup. The\nscale keeps ticking downward, your waist keeps shrinking inward, you’re\nrarely hungry, and you feel like your normal self.\nSometime around the two-month mark, though, you begin to feel “it”—\nthe bodybuilding equivalent of “bonking.” Your energy levels, motivation\nto train, and dietary compliance start to sag, and your hunger, cravings,\nand irritability spike.\nAs far as your body’s concerned, you’re starving to death, and it’s ready\nto fight hammer and tongs to survive. And its prime directive has become\nto eliminate the calorie deficit.\n84 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nSadly, this is something you can only manage, not cure. So long as\nyou’re dieting, your body is going to resist your efforts to get leaner.\nNow for the good news: When you eat more, leptin levels rise, and\nyou feel like someone “turned the lights back on.” In a sense, that’s what’s\nhappening—your body is “rewarding” you for shrinking or erasing the\ncalorie deficit it perceives as a threat to its survival.\nOnce you’ve"

At such\nlevels of body fat, leptin production stabilizes, creating a new normal or\nsettling point, as scientists call it.36 As long as you stay sufficiently active\nand eat plenty of nutritious foods, you can maintain such a physique with\nrelative ease.\nWhat if you want to plumb the lowest levels of body fatness, though?\nWhat if you want to get “shredded”? You know, sub-10 percent body fat for\nmen and sub-20 percent for women?\nThis is different and more difficult territory, the stuff of low-leptin\nbugbears. Once your body fat reaches these levels, leptin production\nbecomes vanishingly low, and for many, this means unyielding hunger,\nlethargy, and irritability.37\nThere’s nothing much they can do about it, either, because aside from\ninjecting synthetic leptin—which costs around $1,000 per day—there’s no\nway to nullify the leptin-mediated side effects of low body fat levels besides\n… gaining body fat.\nYou can stick to your guns, but it’ll take its toll in the form of energy,\nmood, strength, and hormonal health. Basically, you just have to choose\nbetween being “peeled” and feeling like a normal human.\nI’ve been there myself several times.

It’s a game of discipline, perseverance, and delayed gratification,\nand those are always skills worth honing.\nBut anyone who says you can flaunt a “shrink-wrapped” physique 365\ndays per year without sacrificing some of your health and wellbeing is\nlying. And anyone who appears to be doing it effortlessly is posturing or\nusing steroids.\n86 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nThe latter point deserves emphasis because with the right drugs,\neverything changes. Suddenly, you can maintain ridiculously low body-fat\nlevels, crush workouts, gain muscle and strength, and eat a good 20 to 30\npercent more calories than you’d be able to otherwise.\nFor instance, it’s not uncommon for “enhanced” bodybuilders to spend\njust 10 to 12 weeks getting stage-lean, eating upward of 3,000 calories per\nday (just shy of my lean bulking calories) and doing little cardio.\nWe mortals, however, have a much harder time of it, but we get a conso-\nlation prize: Our body doesn’t go to pieces. Steroids are a sexy but sinister\nmistress that wreaks physiological and psychological havoc.\nThere is a way for us natural weightlifters to at least ease the pain of\nlow-leptin living, though: calorie cycling.\nRecall that leptin levels rise and fall based on two factors:\n1. Your daily calorie intake (in the short term).\n2. Your body fatness (in the long term).\nWhen you’re dieting to get lean, there’s nothing you can do about\nnumber two, but you can exploit number one to raise your body’s leptin\nproduction temporarily.\nSpecifically, by periodically raising your calorie intake, you can increase\nyour leptin levels for a few hours or even days, and this can ease some nega-\ntive side effects of calorie restriction in particular.38 Think"

You must get most of your extra calories from carbs.\nResearch shows that eating dietary fat has no effect on leptin levels,\nwhereas significantly increasing carbohydrate intake causes a\nThe Almost Nearly Perfect Diet 87\nsubstantial spike in leptin production that can persist for as long as\nyou maintain your higher-carb eating.39\nIt’s unclear what effect protein has on leptin levels, but it’s likely\ninsignificant compared to carbs.40 That said, some research\nsuggests that high-protein dieting may improve leptin sensitivity,\nso it’s a good idea to keep protein intake high when using carbs to\nboost your body’s leptin production.41\n2. You must eat at maintenance calories for two to three days per week.\nWhy not just eat a very high-carb diet when cutting or maintaining\nlow body-fat levels? If carbs boost leptin levels, wouldn’t this keep\nleptin production perpetually elevated?\nUnfortunately, that won’t do the trick, because the leptin-enhancing\neffects of carbs are short-lived.42 Thus, over time, your average\nleptin levels will be about the same, regardless of how much or\nlittle carbohydrate you’re eating every day.\nA single high-carb meal or day won’t make the grade, either,\nbecause it doesn’t raise leptin levels enough to impact your phys-\niology.43 It takes at least a couple of days (and sometimes up to a\nweek or two) for your brain to recognize and “trust” the increase\nin leptin and respond positively.44\nTherefore, by raising your calories to maintenance two to three\ndays per week and staying in a deficit otherwise, you can make\ngetting ripped more tolerable.\nSo, in summary, calorie cycling can make cutting"

It’s not a game\nchanger, but when leptin levels get low, every bit of help counts.\n88 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nCalorie Cycling and Muscle Building\nCalorie cycling isn’t for people new to weightlifting who want to maxi-\nmize muscle gain. So long as they eat enough calories and protein every\nday, they’ll make rapid progress, and complicating things with calorie\ncycling will only detract from that.\nEven an intermediate lifter is better off keeping it simple when lean\nbulking. He should eat about 10 percent more calories every day than he\nburns, do a lot of heavy weightlifting, and once he’s around 15 to 17 percent\nbody fat, cut down to around 10 percent body fat. Rinse and repeat until he’s\nan advanced weightlifter (someone with at least several years of productive\ntraining who has achieved 80 percent or more of their genetic potential for\nmuscle growth).\nOnly then does calorie cycling become useful for muscle building.\nWhen an advanced lifter wants to make slow, steady muscle and strength\ngains while staying lean (10 to 12 percent body fat), calorie cycling can help.\nIt works well for advanced weightlifters, because once they’ve gained\nmost of the muscle and strength available to them genetically, progress\nslows to a crawl.\nAfter four or five years of proper dieting and training, you’ll be lucky\nto gain a pound of muscle every six months. And by the time you’ve been\ntraining as long as I have—nearly 17 years now—you’d have to sacrifice\na kid to the Dread Lord Cthulhu just to gain a pound of muscle per year.\nWe’ll talk more about this in chapter eleven, but basically, when you\nstart lifting weights, your body’s muscle-building machinery is ready to\nrun at full throttle, whereas later in your bodybuilding journey, it never\ngets out of first or second gear.\nThus, for your first six to even twelve months of training, you can get\ngreat results with a"

As those demands shrink, however—and they do\nas you progress regardless of what you do in the gym—your body doesn’t\nneed as many additional calories to meet them.\nThe Almost Nearly Perfect Diet 89\nIn other words, it requires a much larger calorie surplus to build 20\npounds of muscle (which many guys can do in their first year) than a\ncouple of pounds. In the latter case, 200 to 300 calories over maintenance\nis sufficient.\nThe good news is while muscle growth becomes more elusive as we get\nbigger and stronger, the smaller calorie surplus required to keep progress-\ning diminishes fat gain. So much so that you can lean bulk for many months\nbefore your body-fat levels rise high enough to warrant a cutting phase.\nAnd if you use calorie cycling when lean bulking, you can go even\nlonger. By placing your body in a calorie surplus four to five days per week\nand a deficit on the remaining days, you create a “maintenance with bene-\nfits” scenario where you can gain muscle slowly with very little fat storage.\nHere’s how I like to do it:\nFirst, you want to be in a calorie surplus on the days you train. The surplus\ndoesn’t need to be large—5 to 10 percent above maintenance is enough.\nThen, you restrict your calories on your rest days to lose the fat gained\nwhile in a surplus. As roughly half of the weight gained while lean bulking\nis muscle, and your body needs to utilize a portion of the extra calories to\nbuild that muscle, you don’t need to offset the entire calorie surplus for the\nweek, but only half of it.\nFor example, my total daily energy expenditure is around 2,900 calories\non my lifting days (five per week) and 2,500 on my rest days (two days per\nweek), putting my total weekly calorie expenditure around 19,500.\nThus, if I were cycling my calories, I’d eat about 3,200 on my training\ndays (~"

Which is great … but not without\nits downsides.\n90 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nFor one thing, muscle growth is a process that begins in the gym and\ncompletes several days later, not several hours. By restricting your calories\neven a couple of days per week, you tap the brakes on muscle growth and\nsacrifice some potential gains.\nAdditionally, many people find it difficult to stick to the plan, because\nit takes some enjoyment out of lean bulking. Even if you’re not much of\na foodie, it’s nice to eat a bit off-plan now and then. When you’re calorie\ncycling, however, you must pay closer attention to your day-to-day calorie\nintake. Also, as many people train during the week and take the weekends\noff, eating in a deficit on rest days can make dinner outings, social events,\nand off days less enjoyable.\nAs with everything fitness, however, you don’t have to be perfect to\nmake calorie cycling worthwhile.\nIf you eat a bit too much on a surplus day or two, you can always eat less\non your deficit days to compensate.

If\nyou’re training more than that, however, it’s not going to help much, so I’d\nrecommend either choosing the lean bulk and mini-cut approach or eating\nin a surplus on training days and deficit on rest days.\nIt’s also worth noting that if your primary goal is to stay lean while\nmaking gradual progress, you can simplify things and opt for mini-cuts and\nmini-bulks. This isn’t optimal for maximizing muscle growth, but if you just\nwant to hover around the same body fat percentage while nudging your\nnumbers up in the gym, it can work well (at least for a time).\nOne reason I like this approach is it makes your day-to-day routine\nThe Almost Nearly Perfect Diet 91\nmuch simpler.

Modern medicine thrives on\nspecialization and specificity, not generalization, and so prefers treatments\nthat do one thing very well, like metformin for glucose control and warfarin\nfor blood thinning.\nGarlic’s still an outstanding functional food, though, and most studies\nshowing benefits used aged garlic extract at around 600 to 1,200 milli-\ngrams.6 This is the equivalent of about one to three garlic cloves per day,\ndepending on their size.7\nIdeally, you’d eat garlic raw, as heat destroys the enzyme that helps\ncreate the bioactive compounds that give garlic most of its special proper-\nties. For instance, research shows sixty seconds in the microwave, forty-\nfive minutes in the oven, or fifteen minutes in boiling water can eliminate\nthis enzyme.8\nThat said, heating garlic doesn’t render it worthless, but it relegates\nit to the level of a more basic antioxidant, like blueberry or cranberry, as\nopposed to a source of uniquely beneficial molecules.\nIf the thought of putting down a clove or three of raw garlic every day\nturns your stomach, you have another option: Crush, chop"

Typically,\nI’ll chop it up, let it sit for ten or fifteen minutes while I cook up a stir fry or\nveggie casserole or heat up a soup, chili, or stew, and add the garlic last,\nwhen the dish is ready. This way, the garlic is mostly raw when I eat it.\nCrushed garlic is also a tasty topping for oven-baked fish and chicken\n(cover it with aluminum foil if it starts to turn brown while cooking, because\nit can taste funky if overcooked).\nBlueberry\nBlueberries (and all dark, blue-black berries) are a superior fruit\nbecause of their anthocyanin content, which is a powerful antioxidant linked\nto improved memory, mood, and immunity, as well as less DNA damage,\nwhich helps protect against various types of disease and dysfunction.10\nThe dose required to produce benefits isn’t small, but it’s still work-\nable—60 to 120 grams of fresh blueberries, or about ½ to 1 cup per day.11\nThe highest doses used in studies are around 250 grams, which would be\na chore to eat but easily turned into a juice.\nYou can also opt for frozen blueberries, and aim for about 175 grams\nper day.12 The process of freeze-drying causes minor losses in antioxidant\ncapacity, but this isn’t a cause for concern, because antioxidant levels rise\nin berries after they’re frozen.13\nIf you’re buying a premade blueberry juice, make sure it’s not just\nblueberry-flavored, but made with blueberries.

Sleep poorly for too long and\njust about every important physiological function and system becomes\ncompromised, and your body starts breaking down.\nOn the other hand, the benefits of sleeping well are extensive, including\n…\n• Improved memory, learning, and problem solving6\n• Lower levels of systemic inflammation7\n• Better dietary compliance8\n• Enhanced immunity9\n• Elevated mood10\n• Increased athletic performance11\n• Greater longevity12\nGood sleep hygiene is like a good exercise routine—it improves your\nlife in just about every way.\nThis is why many people turn to hypnotics and sedatives to combat\nsleep troubles, but these drugs are habit forming and associated with a\nrather scary set of side effects, including depression, delirium, nightmares,\nhallucinations, and an increased risk of infections, cancer, and overall\nmortality.13\nA smarter approach to getting better sleep is to first address lifestyle.\nFor instance, the most effective measures include …\n• Avoiding caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and other chemicals that inter-\nfere with sleep. We all know that caffeine and nicotine are stimulants,\nbut alcohol can disrupt our shuteye as well. Although it can help\nbring on sleep, it then acts as a stimulant and increases the number\nof wakings during the night.14 As a general rule, don’t consume any\nsleep-disrupting chemicals four to six hours before going to bed, and\nif you’re sensitive to them (like I am), you’ll probably want to allow\nfor more time.

The more you view getting to bed on time as\na non-negotiable part of your life, like diet and exercise, the better\nyour sleep will be.\n• Keeping your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool, which are all cues for\nthe brain to put the body to sleep. Also, avoid bright lights while\nyou’re getting ready for bed, because they can suppress the produc-\ntion of a sleep-inducing hormone known as melatonin.15\n• Turning off the TV, computer, tablet, or smartphone at least an hour\nbefore bed. These devices emit a light called blue light, which is a\npowerful melatonin suppressant.16\n• Exercising regularly. Studies show that regular exercise improves\nsleep quality in people both with and without sleep problems.17\n• Not exercising too late. Finish your workout at least three hours before\nbedtime to allow your body to “wind down” before going to sleep.\n• Establishing a relaxing pre-sleep routine. Soothing activities like\ntaking a bath, reading a book, listening to calming music, and\nstretching or doing breathing exercises can help you sleep better.\nAdditionally, try to avoid stressful or stimulating conversations or\nactivities before bed.\n• Not lying in bed and staring at the clock. This can make you feel\nstressed, which keeps you awake. Instead, ignore the clock, and if\nyou’re unable to fall asleep in a reasonable amount of time, get up and\noccupy yourself with a quiet, soothing activity like reading or listen-\ning to music until your eyes become droopy.

You lose speed, strength, power, and agility;\nyou often have to quit certain exercises and activities altogether; and your\ndays are plagued by nagging aches and pains.\nLike good sleep, healthy joints are something people just don’t appre-\nciate until they’re gone.\nImproving and supporting joint health starts with healthy living. This\nis one of the many reasons to be a stickler about eating right, training prop-\nerly, and ensuring you get adequate rest and recovery. In some ways, your\njoints reflect how well you take care of your body on the whole.\nSupplementation can help too, mostly by reducing inflammation and\npreserving cartilage, which is a flexible tissue that lubricates joints and\nabsorbs physical impacts.\nMany people assume exercise speeds up cartilage loss through repet-\nitive use and general wear and tear. Research shows otherwise, though—\nforms of exercise usually assumed to be harmful to the joints like weight-\nlifting and even long-distance running are not associated with cartilage\nloss or osteoarthritis.28 In fact, regular exercise appears to help preserve\nhealthy cartilage levels.\nWhy do so many long-term exercisers and athletes suffer from joint\nproblems, then?

And what can be done about it? To answer those ques-\ntions, let’s take a closer look at how joints lose their structural integrity\nand become arthritic.\nTwo common forms of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid\narthritis, and both involve the painful inflammation of the joints resulting\nfrom the gradual loss of cartilage. This was long believed to be a natural\nconsequence of aging, but we now know that both conditions are at least\npartially caused by an unwanted immune response to joint collagen that\neats away at joint cartilage.29\nWhat happens is your body’s immune system targets and attacks joint\ncartilage as a foreign and undesirable substance. This triggers a degener-\native cycle that, over time, causes irreparable damage to the joints.\n118 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nAfter discovering this, scientists wondered what would happen if they\ncould somehow stop or slow this internal assault on the joints. Theoret-\nically, this could improve joint health and reduce the risk of disease and\ndysfunction. And that’s what later research found.\nSpecifically, studies show that “teaching” the immune system to stop\nattacking proteins in joint cartilage improves joint health and function and\ncan, in some people, alleviate or even eliminate pain and swelling.30\nThere are several supplements that do this, as well as a few that simply\nreduce inflammation, which also helps your joints:\n1. Undenatured type II collagen\n2. Curcumin\n3. Boswellia serrata\n4. Grape seed extract\n5. Glucosamine\nLet’s review each.\nUndenatured Type II Collagen\nCollagen is the main protein in the various connective tissues in animals,\nand type II collagen makes up your joint cartilage.\n“Undenatured” is often a meaningless marketing buzzword, but in this\ncase, it’s a vitally important component of the supplement.\nDenaturation is the alteration of the natural structure of a substance,\nusually by the addition of another chemical or heat.

Common processing\nmethods used to prepare collagen for supplementation denature it, and\nresearch shows that denatured collagen has no beneficial effects on joint\ninflammation.31\nUndenatured collagen, however, is a more natural form of the substance,\nand studies show that it’s effective for regulating the immune response that\ninflames joints and destroys cartilage and bone. It accomplishes this by\nHow to Upgrade Your Supplementation (and What to Avoid) 119\ntraining the immune system to stop attacking collagen in the joints.32\nIt gets better, too: These effects have been demonstrated in both people\nwith arthritic conditions and healthy joints. That is, whether you have joint\nproblems or not, you can benefit from supplementing with undenatured\ntype II collagen.\nCurcumin\nCurcumin is the orange pigment found in the turmeric plant, which\nis the main spice in curry. It has been used therapeutically in Ayurvedic\nmedicine for thousands of years, and its health benefits are extensive.\nFor instance, scientists around the world are investigating curcumin’s\neffects on a variety of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease,\nosteoporosis, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and more.33\nCurcumin also produces healthier, less painful joints by inhibiting a\npro-inflammatory enzyme known as cyclooxygenase (COX), and this has\npowerful anti-inflammatory effects in the body.34\nUnfortunately, circumin is poorly absorbed in the intestines.35 So much\nso, studies show that to enjoy most of its benefits, you must take a patented\n(and expensive) form of curcumin that’s combined with a natural substance\nknown as phosphatidylcholine (Meriva) or combine generic curcumin with\nanother ingredient to enhance absorption, like black pepper extract, which\nincreases its bioavailability twentyfold.36\nBoswellia Serrata\nBoswellia serrata is a plant native to much of India and Pakistan.

This is wrongheaded.\nLike with exercise, our body was designed to use the “fight-or-flight”\nresponse to deal with stress, and it wouldn’t be far off the mark to say that\nregular bouts of stress are conducive to our overall health and well-being.\nFor instance, as you’ll learn in the next section of this book, to continue\nmaking progress in your fitness, you’ll need to work a lot harder in the gym\nthan when you were a beginner. And that means subjecting your body to\nmore exercise-induced stress.\nThis is fine and necessary, but chances are your workouts aren’t the\nonly source of stress in your life. Like most of us, you’re also dealing with\nother difficult situations, ranging from finances to politics, work, relation-\nships, health issues, and whatever else is fraying your nerves.\nThis isn’t inherently unhealthy, but our body and mind can only take so\nmuch before the wheels start to fall off. When we endure too much stress,\nwe remain on high alert and age faster, become more susceptible to disease,\nand experience elevated levels of systemic inflammation.48\nThe solution isn’t to avoid stress as much as possible, then, but to\nmanage it. That starts with lifestyle, including making time for rest,\n122 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nrecovery, and relaxation.

The meteoric rise of steroid use has\ncomplicated matters further, because while some guys (and gals) are so\nbig and strong that steroids are obviously involved, many drug users fly\nunder the radar and represent unrealistic expectations.\nTo avoid the issue of secret anabolic use, often people point to the\nexceptional muscularity of bodybuilders before the advent of synthetic\n136 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\ntestosterone and other steroids in the late 1930s, like the great Eugen\nSandow:\nThis, they say, is the purest, cleanest example of what’s possible without\ndrugs.\nIf only it were that simple. The home truth is this: We can only gain so\nmuch muscle naturally, and no amount of training, eating, or supplementing\nwill raise that ceiling. Furthermore, it’s impossible to calculate or predict\nthat ceiling precisely, but there are several research-backed methods for\nestimating how jacked we can get.\nThere’s good news, too: Chances are you haven’t reached your peak\nmuscularity yet. In fact, you’re probably nowhere close.\nMy progress is a good example of this.

And just in case it needs saying,\nI’ve never used steroids, prohormones, SARMs, clenbuterol, or any other\ncutting or anabolic drug (besides caffeine, synephrine, and ephedrine).\nThe moral of the story is you may think your DNA dealt you a busted\nflush, but it probably didn’t. Although you can only gain so much muscle,\nthe amount is likely a lot more than what you see in the mirror and certainly\nmore than enough to look and feel great about your body.\nAnd in this chapter, you’ll get clear answers to all your most pressing\nHow Much Muscle Can You Really Gain (Naturally)? 139\nquestions about your muscle building potential, including …\n• How much muscle can you gain naturally?\n• Why can some people gain more muscle than others?\n• What’s the most surefire way to reach your genetic potential for\nmuscle growth as fast as possible?\n• And more\nLet’s get started.\nWhat Determines How Much Muscle\nYou Can Build Naturally?\nThere are many calculators and formulas floating around online that\nclaim to show how much muscle you can add to your frame. While some can\ngive you a ballpark estimate, don’t put too much stock into their estimations,\nbecause there’s no perfect way to predict how big you can get. There are\ntoo many physiological variables. This is why even genetic testing provides\nonly an informed guesstimate.1\nThat said, science has revealed two physical traits that are highly\ncorrelated with the genetic potential for muscle gain:\n1. Bone structure\n2. Muscle structure\nLet’s review each.\nBone Structure\nIt’s true—some big people are just “big boned.”\nResearch shows that those with larger, denser bones tend to have more\n140 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nmuscle than people with smaller frames.2 Furthermore, they also tend to\nhave higher testosterone levels and respond better to training.3\nThis relationship is"

One\nresearcher in particular, Francis Holway, has even gone as far as calculat-\ning what he believes is the exact ratio of how much muscle you can gain\naccording to how much bone you have.\nHere’s how David Epstein explains it in his 2014 bestselling book The\nSports Gene:\nIn measurements of thousands of elite athletes from soccer to weight\nlifting, judo, rugby, and more, Holway has found that each kilogram\n(2.2 pounds) of bone supports a maximum of five kilograms (11\npounds) of muscle.\nIn other words, according to Holway, most people can gain about 5\npounds of muscle for every pound of bone in their bodies.\nEpstein likens the human skeleton to a bookcase, and the muscle to\nbooks, writing, “One bookcase that is four inches wider than another will\nweigh only slightly more. But fill both cases with books and suddenly the\nlittle bit of extra width on the broader bookcase translates to a considerable\namount of weight.”\nAlso worth noting is the ratio seems to be slightly lower—about 4.1\npounds of muscle to 1 pound of bone—in women, which may help explain\nwhy women’s potential for muscularity is less than men’s.\nYou might now be wondering how to accurately measure your total\nbone mass and thereby muscular potential.\nUnfortunately, it involves a trained anthropometrist (body measurer)\ntaking twenty-two different measurements across your body, which is\nexpensive and inconvenient. Some people say you can use a full-body x-ray\ncalled a DXA scan instead, but that’s not a workable solution either. DXA\ndetermines the mineral content of your bone, not the total weight, which\nincludes marrow, blood, and other components.4\nHow Much Muscle Can You Really Gain (Naturally)? 141\nSo, while the muscle-to-bone ratio is probably the best method we have\nfor determining the maximum amount of muscle we can build naturally,\nit’s unfeasible.\nInstead, however, we"

These\nmeasurements work because height being equal, people who have wider\nwrists and ankles tend to be more muscular, gain muscle faster through\ntraining, and have a higher potential for muscle growth.\nWe can thank a researcher named Dr. Casey Butt for figuring this out.\nHe parsed thousands of data points from surveys, clinical studies, and\ncase studies, and found the single best indicator of bone mass and thus\nmuscle-building potential was the thickness of the wrists and ankles.\nWhy these two points of the body?\nIt’s likely that you could also find a similar relationship using other\nbones like the femur (thigh bone), humerus (upper arm bone), and clavicle\n(collar bone), but they’re too draped in flesh to allow for easy measurement.\nThat isn’t the case with the wrists and ankles, though.\nMuscle Structure\nEvery muscle has two main parts:\n1. The “belly,” which is the part that contracts and that you want to\ngrow.\n2. The tendon, which connects the belly to your skeleton.\nThe main way muscle bellies and tendons vary in people is length.\nMuscles can’t grow longer, only wider, so the longer your muscle bellies and\nthe shorter your tendons are, the more muscle mass you’ll be able to gain.5\nSimilarly, the shorter your bellies and the longer your tendons are, the\nlower your potential for muscularity. Here’s a good example of someone\nwith very short muscle bellies and long tendons:\n142 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nWhile he has good muscle definition, he will have a hell of a time getting\nbodybuilding-big arms.

If you can fit two, you’re about average.\nIf you can fit one, you’re one of the lucky few with longer than average\nmuscle bellies.\nIf you’re on #TeamSmallBelly, don’t worry, you aren’t SOL. Take heart\nbecause …\n• Small muscle bellies in one muscle group (your biceps) doesn’t\nmean the same will hold true in other muscle groups.\n• Although your potential for raw size might be more limited than\nsome, you can always develop great muscle definition.\n• There are other factors that are better predictors of how muscular\nyou can get (which you’ll learn more about).\nAnd let’s face it: there isn’t a natural bodybuilder in the world with 10\nout of 10 size and definition in every muscle group, so let’s be thankful for\nour strengths (yippee, chest and biceps for me) and accepting of our weak\npoints (screw you, calves).\nSo, How Much Muscle Can You Build Naturally?\nBy this point, you’ve probably had enough appetizers and are ready for\nyour entrée. So let’s serve it up. How can you determine how much muscle\nyou can gain?\nMost formulas for this are solely based on height. The theory is the\ntaller you are, the more “room” you have to add muscle to your body.\nThere’s truth here, but it’s too simplistic to produce accurate estimates\nfor people of all sizes and types. For example, what if you’re below-aver-\nage in height but above-average in bone size? You’d be able to gain more\nmuscle than a height-based formula would predict. That’s why I prefer\nCasey Butt’s formula.\n144 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nCasey Butt’s Model for Predicting Muscular Potential\nButt’s equations are widely considered the most accurate way to esti-\nmate your genetic potential for muscle growth as well as the maximum\npotential size of each major muscle group.\nHere’s what they look like …\nMaximum Lean Body Mass = H1."

Therefore, it’s smart to look at\nyour numbers from the calculator as an absolute ceiling of what you could\nachieve if you did everything right with your training and nutrition for years,\nrather than middle-of-the-road expectations.\nI think it’s reasonable to subtract 5 percent from the calculator’s results\nfor a more conservative estimate of how big we can get, without more or\nless devoting our lives to lifting weights.\nFor example, when I plug in my numbers, the calculator pegs my ceiling\nat 210 pounds at 10 percent body fat. I’m sitting at 192 pounds right now at\n9 percent body fat, and based on my nearly twenty years in the gym, I can\nsay with some certainty that I have a snail’s chance in saltwater of reaching\n210 pounds and lean.\nIf I subtract 5 percent from 210, however, I get 199, which would require\njust a few pounds of muscle and fat gain.

If a guy\nhas been in the gym for many years but only gained, let’s say, 15 pounds of\nmuscle, he’s essentially a beginner ready to start his second year.\nSo, according to this model, a 150-pound male beginner can gain about\n1.5 to 2.25 pounds of muscle per month, or 18 to 27 pounds in year one.\nLet’s say he does well and gains 20 pounds of muscle in his first year and\nis now an “intermediate lifter” who can expect to gain 0.85 to 1.7 pounds of\nmuscle per month, or 10 to 20 pounds in his second year in the gym.\nLet’s say he now really dials in his diet and training and gains another\n15 pounds of muscle in year two, putting him at 185 pounds (assuming the\nsame body fat levels as when he began) as he enters his “advanced” phase.\nThus, his year-three potential gains are about 5 to 10 pounds of muscle,\nand from there on out, his progress diminishes to the vanishing point.\nHow Much Muscle Can You Really Gain (Naturally)? 147\nThis example mirrors my journey in a way.

Being big and strong is just in his genes.\nSo my point is this: It doesn’t take stellar DNA to build a body you can\nbe proud of.

For example, if I magically doubled my body weight,\nI wouldn’t be twice as strong, and likewise, if I shrunk to half my current\nsize, I wouldn’t be half as strong.\nSo how much do increases or decreases in body weight impact\nstrength? To find the answer, we can use a technique known as allometric\nHow Much Strength Can You Really Gain (Naturally)? 153\nscaling, which is a method that helps scientists understand how different\ncharacteristics change in an organism as size changes.\nFor instance, thanks to this line of research, we know that for most\nanimal species, as the body size increases, the metabolic rate per unit of\nmass decreases.1 (Good news for elephants, who still need to eat 200 to 600\npounds of food every day!)\nPowerlifter, researcher, and writer Greg Nuckols gets all the credit\nhere, as he’s the one who figured out how to make allometric scaling work\nfor predicting strength in humans. With a formula he created, you can\ncalculate a number that represents your relative strength and then compare\nit to the figures of others to see where you stand.\nThe only problem is it looks like double Dutch to most of us, so instead\nof wading through the math, you can find a calculator that’ll do the “heavy\nlifting” for you at www.bblsbook.com/strength.\nThere are other formulas out there for calculating relative strength,\nsuch as the Wilks, Glossbrenner, and Schwartz/Malone coefficients, but\nthey’re less accurate than Nuckols’ method. For example …\n• It’s well known the Wilks coefficient misestimates the relative\nstrength of people who weigh between 150 and 200 pounds.\n• The Schwarz/Malone coefficient often overestimates the relative\nstrength of people who weigh less than 150 pounds.\n• The Glossbrenner coefficient more or less just averages the results\nfrom the Wilks and Schwarz/Malone coefficients, but this doesn’t\novercome their flaws.\nAs Nuckols explains in his extensive article on the topic, allometric\nscaling may not be perfect, but it’s a better, scientifically-validated system\nfor computing relative strength than the other popular methods"

Lifting large amounts of weight with proper tech-\nnique requires outstanding balance, coordination, and timing, and that’s\nwhy your first squat, bench press, and deadlift sessions felt awkward,\nuncoordinated, and weak.\nAccordingly, your strength is limited by not only your musculature but also\nyour movement patterns, which are flawed and inefficient in the beginning.\nAfter a month or two of regular practice, though, your technique can\nrapidly improve along with your strength. In fact, research shows that most\nof the strength people gain in their first month of lifting weights is the result\nof improvements in coordination and technique, not muscle growth.3\nThese “technique gains” taper off quickly, though, and after a year of\nregular lifting, your ability to perform key exercises is about as good as it’ll\never be. You can still improve your skill as time goes on, but the process\nwill be slow and subtle.\nYour attitude in the gym matters, too, because approaching your genetic\nlimit for strength requires a bit of piss and vinegar.\nTo get there, you will need to do a lot of heavy weightlifting, which\nmeans getting comfortable being uncomfortable, pushing yourself to add\nHow Much Strength Can You Really Gain (Naturally)? 155\nweight to the bar, and staying focused through weeks, months, and years\nof strenuous training.\nIn short, showing up and going through the motions isn’t enough. You\nhave to strive to make every rep, set, and workout count.\nBone Length\nEvery exercise involves moving a weight a certain way for a certain\ndistance.

Sitting position with your thighs more or less parallel with the floor.\n3. Standing position with the legs straight.\nWhile small differences in individual anatomy don’t change this basic\npattern, they can alter how easy or difficult the exercise is by changing how\nfar the weight needs to move to perform each rep.\nFor example, if your femurs are longer than average, you’ll find the\nsquat and deadlift more difficult, because the bar will have to travel a few\ninches farther every rep. For the same reason, if your arms are longer than\naverage, you’ll find the bench and military press more difficult, but the\ndeadlift will be easier, because the bar won’t have to move as far to lock out.\nBeing 6’1” with long legs and arms, I’ve experienced this firsthand.\nThe squat, bench press, and military press have always been the hardest to\nprogress on, and my current personal bests are respectable, but nothing to\nwrite home about: a 365-pound squat for two or three reps, 295-pound bench\nfor two reps, and 225-pound seated military press for two or three reps.\nDeadlifting, however, has been somewhere in the middle for me, as my\nlong legs make it harder, but long arms make it easier. My personal best\nis still just middling (435 pounds for two reps), but was easier to achieve\nthan the other lifts.\nI can’t blame my anatomy too much, though, because structural\n156 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\ndifferences don’t have as big of an impact on strength gain as many people\nclaim. First, every inch of height only increases the distance the bar needs to\nmove by a small amount, and second, even having to move the bar an inch or\ntwo more doesn’t always significantly increase the difficulty of the exercise.\nTo understand why, you must understand that every exercise has a\nsticking point. This is a point in the movement where the exercise becomes\nmore difficult, and it typically makes up about three to six inches of the total\ndistance the weight needs to travel.\n(It would be more accurate to describe this as a sticking range, since\nit’s a few inches, but I’ll stick with the"

If you can\nmove through this spot quickly, you’ll probably complete the rep without\na hitch, and if you can’t, you’ll probably grind to a halt.\nFor instance, most people’s sticking point on the bench press is when\nthe bar is three to six inches off their chest and continues for another three\nto six inches. Once you get the bar through this span of the ascent, the rest\nfeels easy.\nHow does this relate to bone length and strength?\nI’ll use myself as an example again. Compared to my 5’10” lifting part-\nner, I have to move the bar about two to three inches farther to complete\neach rep of the bench press. Only an inch or two are added to my sticking\npoint, though, while the rest of the additional distance isn’t as difficult. And\nyes, that means my reps are harder than his and produce more fatigue as\nI get deeper into sets, but this isn’t likely to put me more than a rep or two\nbehind him on most sets.\nSomething else to consider is the fact that taller people can often gain\nmore total muscle than shorter people, which can help mitigate anatomical\ndisadvantages. Additionally, having long bones may be a disadvantage in\none exercise, but an advantage in another. As I just mentioned, my long\narms make bench pressing harder, but they also make deadlifting easier.\nMy long femurs, on the other hand, make deadlifting and squatting harder\nHow Much Strength Can You Really Gain (Naturally)? 157\nand don’t help my bench press.\nSo all things considered, if someone can lift more weight than you,\nchances are that variations in height and proportions aren’t the driving\nfactors.

These discrepancies are usually small—only a centimeter\nor two—but they can translate into huge differences in natural strength.\nWe don’t need to get too technical for this discussion, but what it boils\ndown to is mechanical advantage. Because muscles function as levers,\nwhere they attach to our bones impacts how much force they can produce\nand thus how much weight they can move. This is why studies have found\nthat, thanks to this type of anatomical variance, strength can vary by as\nmuch as 25 percent among people with identical amounts of muscle mass.4\nIf you’re worried that you’re in the disadvantaged camp, take heart,\nbecause this should only concern you if you’re trying to become a compet-\nitive strength athlete. However, if you’re here to build a strong, muscular,\nlean, healthy body, you can achieve your goals with or without a genetic\nleg up.\nBut do keep anatomy in mind when comparing yourself to other people\nof similar size—some bodies are just built better for strength than others.\nMuscle Size\nGenerally, the biggest guys in the gym are also the strongest. Sure,\nthere are exceptions, but more often than not, the people moving big loads\nare pretty jacked.\n158 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nThis is clear to anyone who has spent enough time with the iron, but\nit’s also backed by scientific research. For instance, studies conducted by\nscientists at Indiana University and the University of San Martin found that\nmuscle mass is strongly associated with strength among powerlifters.5\nThis doesn’t mean that every pound you add to the barbell makes you\na little more muscular, though, because strength and muscle gains aren’t\nperfectly correlated. In other words, you can get stronger without getting\nbigger and vice versa.\nFor example, most of the strength you gain during the first few weeks\nof lifting comes from getting better at exercises—those “technique gains”\nI mentioned earlier.6 Your muscles contract harder and at the right times,\nyour balance improves, and your technique becomes respectable.

You still\ngain some muscle during this beginning period, but that only accounts for\nabout 2 percent of the rather large jump in strength.7\nAfter you’ve worked out the bugs in your form, however, which happens\nin the first few months for most people, further increases in strength\nbecome largely dependent on gaining muscle. And after a couple of years\nof consistent training, research shows about 65 percent of your strength\ngain will come from muscle gain.8\nSo, once your newbie gains are behind you, if you want to keep getting\nstronger, you’ll have to keep getting bigger. And once you reach your\ngenetic potential for muscle growth, you won’t have much more strength\navailable to you, either.\nThe best way to think of the relationship between muscle and strength is\nthis: the amount of muscle you have represents your potential for strength.\nFor instance, let’s say you use lighter weights and higher reps during\na lean bulk and gain five pounds of muscle. Since you weren’t using heavy\nloads and lower reps and are a bit “rusty” at that type of training, when you\nattempt to set new one-rep maxes, you fall short of your previous bests.\nThis might leave you confused or even crestfallen, but here’s the good\nnews: if you were to train with heavy weights and low reps for four to six\nweeks, you’d likely beat your previous lifts.\nWhy? Because those five additional pounds of muscle will allow you to\nHow Much Strength Can You Really Gain (Naturally)? 159\ngenerate more force than before. You just have to readapt your muscles to\nheavier loads and fewer reps.\nSo … How Strong Can You Get Naturally?\nI hate answering important questions like this with “it depends,” but\nthat’s the truth here.\nIt’s hard to determine how strong you’ll be able to get, because there\nare too many factors in play. Unlike the potential for muscularity, there\nisn’t one individual variable that we can isolate and use as a guidepost for\npotential strength.\nThat said, there is a way to estimate how strong you can get.

Chances are, you’ll fall somewhere\nin the middle.\nWhile there are no comprehensive studies on strength potential, Greg\nNuckols has conducted an unofficial study of the matter that lends some\ninsight.9\nNuckols collected survey responses from 1,800 experienced weightlift-\ners of all sizes, used the allometric scaling method you learned about earlier\nto assess their relative strength levels, and then assigned their squat, bench\npress, and deadlift one-rep maxes, and total, into six categories:\n1. Beginner\n2. Novice\n3. Intermediate\n4. Advanced\n5. Elite\n6. World Class\nHe also created a calculator that allows you to discover what category\nyou’re currently in, which you can find at www.bblsbook.com/strength.\n160 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nFor instance, when I plug in my height and weight, it says “beginner”\nlevel lifts for my size are 319 pounds on the squat, 213 pounds on the bench,\nand 359 pounds on the deadlift. My all-time best one-rep maxes are 375\npounds on the squat, 300 pounds on the bench, and 445 pounds on the\ndeadlift, which puts me in the novice category. And that’s not too shabby\nconsidering I’ve never trained to maximize my strength.\nIf I focused on nothing but strength training for a while, the best I (and\nmost others, including you, probably) could hope for—regardless of how\nhard I tried—would be somewhere between intermediate and advanced\n(the middle of the curve).\nWith enough drugs, maybe I could reach the advanced tier, but no\nmatter how much vitamin S I took, I’d never be able to put up elite or world\nclass numbers.

There are many ways to make workouts harder,\nbut for our purposes, the two we need to focus on are progressive overload\nand volume.\nIn other words, if we’re going to continue to eke out more muscle and\nstrength, we must ensure that no matter what we do with our diets, work-\nout programming, and supplementation, we’re continuing to add weight to\nthe bar over time and doing a sufficient amount of work per major muscle\ngroup per week (volume).\nLet’s take a moment to elaborate on that principle, because it’s crucial\nto understanding why the Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger program is laid\nout the way it"

This is referred\nto as volume load. So, for example, if you do 3 sets of 5 reps of squats with\n315 pounds, your volume load would be 4,725 pounds (3 x 5 x 315).\nThis formula produces big, impressive numbers that can be fun to track,\nbut changes in volume load don’t correlate well with muscle or strength\ngain, so it’s not a practical programming tool.\nFor example, let’s say you switch from 3 sets of 5 reps of squats with\n315 pounds to 3 sets of 12 reps of squats with 185 pounds. This bumps up\nyour volume load to 6,660 pounds—a 40 percent increase—but research\nThe “More for Less” Method of Maximum Muscle Gain 167\nshows that this isn’t likely to produce more muscle growth and will probably\nresult in less strength gain.1\nWhy is that?\nAccording to a systematic review conducted by scientists at Auckland\nUniversity of Technology, any weightlifting set taken close to failure in the\nrange of 6 to 20 reps will produce about the same amount of muscle gain.2\nThat is, a set of 6 reps taken just shy of failure will produce similar results\nas a set of 20 reps taken just shy of failure.\nThat means wildly different volume loads can produce more or less\nthe same amount of muscle gain, so how are you supposed to use those\nnumbers to optimize muscle growth? You can’t.\nAnother way to track your training volume is total repetitions, but this\nis flawed for the same reason volume load is. Using the same example as\nearlier, 3 x 5 reps gives you 60 percent fewer reps than 3 x 12 reps, yet both\nof these workouts are likely to produce similar amounts of muscle growth.\nSo, what’s the best way to quantify volume"

Most research shows that the answer is hard sets, which are\nsets taken close to the point of muscular failure, regardless of the number\nof reps performed.3\nThis measure is useful because a growing body of evidence indicates\nthat optimal volume for muscle gain is in the range of 10 to 20 hard sets per\nmajor muscle group per week with moderately heavy weights (60 percent\nof one-rep max or higher) and adequate rest in between sets, with the\nlower number of sets being suitable for beginners and the higher end for\nadvanced weightlifters.4\nIrrespective of volume loads or total repetitions, someone new to proper\nweightlifting probably doesn’t need to do more than 10 hard sets per major\nmuscle group per week to gain plenty of muscle and strength, and inter-\nmediate and advanced weightlifters probably need to do upward of fifteen\nto 20 hard sets per week to continue making progress.\nNow, as you’ll learn in this chapter, there are benefits to working in\ndifferent rep ranges (and thus volume loads). For example, research shows\nthat you’ll gain more strength by training with heavier weights and fewer\n168 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nreps, and we know the primary goal as a natural weightlifter is to increase\nwhole-body strength over time.\nResearch also shows, however, that higher-rep sets may activate certain\nmuscle-building processes more than lower-rep sets and cause less fatigue\nand wear and tear on your joints.5\nIdeally, then, you’d alternate systematically between doing more and\nfewer reps, instead of working in the same rep ranges for long periods. And\nthat’s exactly what you’ll do in the Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger program.\nMore importantly, however, you’ll keep progressively overloading\nyour muscles.\nRecall from Bigger Leaner Stronger that progressive overload is the\nprimary mechanical driver of muscle growth.

That said, if used intelligently, one of these tools can enhance\nyour results and is part and parcel of the Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger\nprogram: periodization.\nThe Power of Periodization\nPeriodization refers to how you organize your training over time, typi-\ncally leading up to a competition or an attempt to set a new personal record.\nAt bottom, periodization splits your training into different periods (hence\nthe word) in which you focus on different aspects of your fitness.\n170 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nFor example, if you’re preparing for a powerlifting meet, you want to\nfocus on heavy, low-rep compound training in the month or two before the\ncompetition, so your muscles are primed for the demands of the meet.\nThe month or two before that, however, you might do lighter, higher-rep\ntraining, with more accessory exercises to strengthen the same muscles\nyou use to squat, bench press, and deadlift.\nHence, your training would be periodized, as you’d be working in\ndifferent rep ranges on different exercises over two to four months as you\nfocus on different goals.\nWhile there are many theories on the best way to periodize your weight-\nlifting, the most viable ones are all based on a few simple principles:\n1. Your training involves progressive overload in the form of more\nweight, sets, or reps (with weightlifting), or faster pacing, longer\ndistances, more complex movements, less rest, or some other\nmethod in"

Your training shifts from less specific to more specific as you\nprogress through the plan. With weightlifting, since competitions\ninvolve lifting very heavy weights for single reps, this principle\ngenerally means progressing from lighter weights and higher reps\n(less specific to the sport) to heavier weights and lower reps (more\nspecific).\n3. Your training includes planned breaks to allow for additional rest\nand recovery.\nWhen used correctly, this approach allows you to thread the needle\nbetween stress and recuperation, by providing enough stimulus in the way\nof volume and weight to keep progressing, but not so much as to court\ninjury, overtraining, or burnout.\nThis is why athletes of all stripes, including bodybuilders, gymnasts,\nrunners, basketball, football, and soccer players—even surfers—use peri-\nodization in their training.10\nThe “More for Less” Method of Maximum Muscle Gain 171\nHow Does Periodization Work?\nTo understand how periodization works, it helps to grasp a bit of its\nhistory, which stretches back to research conducted in the early 1950s by\na Hungarian endocrinologist named Hans Selye.11\nSelye developed a theory about how we respond to stress known as\nthe general adaptation syndrome, which states that the body responds to\nstress—including exercise—in three phases:12\n1. Alarm, where the body initially responds to the stressor (increased\nheart rate, stress hormones, etc.).\n2. Adaptation, where the body recovers and gets stronger if given\nenough rest.\n3. Exhaustion, where the body fails to recover and gets weaker\nbecause of too little rest.\nAs an athlete or someone who just hopes to get more jacked, you want\nto repeatedly alarm your body and then allow it to adapt, while staying away\nfrom the exhaustion phase.\nInspired by Selye’s findings, Russian physiologist Leo Matveyev began\nanalyzing the training programs of successful and unsuccessful Soviet\nathletes from the 1952 and 1956 Summer Olympics.13 He found that either\ndeliberately or accidentally, the most successful athletes in a"

Additionally, their training\nwas planned in undulating cycles of first honing the fundamentals and then\nfocusing on competition-specific workouts.\nMatveyev organized and codified these practices, creating a system we\nnow know as linear periodization. With weightlifters, this approach called\nfor increasing intensity and decreasing volume as they approached their\ncompetitions, with planned breaks throughout to avoid overtraining.\n172 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nMatveyev’s system was adopted across the USSR and East Germany\nto great effect—these countries quickly became the dominant forces in\nOlympic lifting and many other sports, and they stayed on top for the next\nseveral decades.\nAlthough later systems of periodization implement these principles in\nslightly different ways, virtually all have their origin in Matveyev’s work.\nIn most cases, training is broken up into three distinct phases or periods.\nFirst, you have the longest phase, the macrocycle, which is a long-term\nview centered around preparing for a particular event or improving body\ncomposition or physical conditioning. For recreational weightlifters, this\ngenerally means setting a new personal record or gaining muscle or losing fat.\nMacrocycles can last anywhere from a few months to several years,\ndepending on the activity, individual, and goals. In bodybuilding, they typi-\ncally last three to six months (around the length of a typical lean bulking\nor cutting cycle).\nThe second longest phase is the mesocycle, which focuses on developing\na particular skill or quality (muscle growth, strength, etc.). A mesocycle\nusually lasts one to four months, so in bodybuilding, there are often a couple\nof mesocycles within each macrocycle.\nThe shortest phase is the microcycle, and it’s typically defined as a\nseveral-day period of vigorous training followed by a short period of lighter\ntraining or rest.

For example, you might train five days per week and\ntake two days off, which would be a seven-day microcycle. A microcycle\nnormally comprises a week’s worth of training, but some people use shorter\nor longer microcycles.\nYou don’t have to set up your training this way to periodize it, but that’s\nhow most people go about it, and how the Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger\nworkouts are programmed.\nFurthermore, this book uses a more sophisticated method of period-\nization than Bigger Leaner Stronger, because when you’re new to lifting, all\nyou need is a simple, linear style of periodization that has you striving to\nadd reps to sets and weight to the bar (or dumbbells) for a couple of months\nbefore deloading and repeating.\nThe “More for Less” Method of Maximum Muscle Gain 173\nThat’s also why in Bigger Leaner Stronger, you …\n• work within specific rep ranges;\n• take hard sets to within a rep or two of technical failure (the point\nwhere you can’t do another rep with proper form);\n• push to gain reps over your previous week’s workouts;\n• increase the weight when you reach the top of your rep range; and\n• deload and change up your exercises every eight weeks.\nThis method of training is simple, fun, and powerfully effective, as\nevidenced by the hundreds of success stories from men of all ages and\ncircumstances I’ve featured on my website (www.legionathletics.com) and\nsocial media accounts.\nAfter your first year or two of that style of training, however, the game\nchanges, and a more complex periodization plan makes more sense.\nGood evidence of this is a study conducted by scientists at Appalachian\nState University that analyzed fifteen studies comparing periodized training\nprograms to non-periodized programs.14 The researchers found that in thir-\nteen out of the fifteen cases, people got stronger or improved their perfor-\nmance more with a periodized training plan versus a non-periodized one.\nWhat’s more, the two studies that found periodization didn’t improve\nperformance were shorter than the others and involved"

What\nthey questioned were the most effective ways to use and study periodization\nand measure its benefits. Their disagreements were regarding the technical\ndetails of periodization, not its fundamental merits.\nAnother claim you may have heard is that periodization is good for\nimproving strength, but not muscle growth. This isn’t entirely off base, but\nit isn’t exactly correct, either.\nIt’s true that most of the studies on periodization show it’s more effec-\ntive for gaining strength than muscle, but most of these studies also only\nlasted four to eight weeks. Because you can gain strength faster than\nmuscle, this isn’t enough time for the muscle-building benefits of period-\nization to manifest in a statistically significant way—especially considering\nhow slowly intermediate and advanced weightlifters gain muscle.\nFor example, let’s say periodization can increase muscle gain"

In most cases, that difference wouldn’t be statis-\ntically significant, but over enough time, it would add up to a real advantage.\nThere’s also a good reason to believe periodization would indeed\nincrease muscle gain. In fact, we’ve already discussed it: As you become a\nmore experienced weightlifter, the most reliable way to gain muscle is to\nget stronger. And as we know that periodization can boost strength gain,\nit’s reasonable to assume it can boost muscle growth, too.\nWhat method of periodization should you use though? Let’s find out.\nThe “More for Less” Method of Maximum Muscle Gain 175\nTypes of Periodization\nThere are many ways to periodize your workouts, and many opinions\non which is best.\nSome people say classic linear periodization is all we need. Others say\nundulating periodization is better. And still others say methods like block\nperiodization, reverse linear periodization, or conjugate periodization is the\nclear winner.\nWho’s right? Before we get into that, let’s define the most popular\nperiodization systems out there.\n• Linear periodization involves increasing intensity (weight) and\nusually reducing volume (sets) over the course of a macrocycle.\n• Reverse linear periodization is like linear periodization, except\neach macrocycle starts with heavier weights and less volume and\nprogresses to lighter weights and more volume.\n• Undulating periodization involves changing the weights, reps, and\nsets you use day to day or week to week, but not the exercises.\n• Block periodization focuses on a handful of exercises for one meso-\ncycle (generally a month or two).\n• Conjugate periodization involves changing your exercises, weights,\nreps, and sets day to day or week to week.

This is similar to undu-\nlating periodization, but more haphazard.\nEach of these systems also involves increasing the weights lifted over\ntime, usually according to a regular pattern, like every workout or week,\nfor instance.\nSo which method is the best? None of them.\nFirst, although they have different names and protocols, they’re more\nalike than different in that each follows the same three principles you\nlearned earlier:\n1. Progressive overload in the form of more weight, sets, or reps.\n176 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\n2. Increasing specificity as you progress through the plan by moving\nfrom lighter weights and higher reps to heavier weights and lower\nreps or vice versa.\n3. Planning breaks to allow for rest and recovery.\nSecond, each method has inherent advantages and disadvantages, so\ninstead of wedding yourself to one, it’s probably best to use a mix of differ-\nent styles. And that’s not just my opinion, either—there’s strong evidence\nthat mixing different periodization techniques is optimal for strength and\nmuscle gain.\nIn a study conducted by scientists at Arizona State University, twenty\n21-year-old weightlifters with an average of five years training experience\nwere split into two groups:17\n1. Group one followed a traditional linear periodization workout\nplan, which involved increasing intensity and decreasing volume\nthroughout the study.\n2. Group two followed a daily undulating periodization plan, with a\nmix of high-intensity, low-rep and low-intensity, high-rep training\nthroughout the week.\nThe scientists ensured both groups did the same number of reps and\nsets and the same exercises with the same technique, and they tested\neveryone’s bench press and leg press one-rep maxes before and after the\ntwelve-week study.\nHere’s what the two training plans looked like:\nThe “More for Less” Method of Maximum Muscle Gain 177\nWeeks 1 to 4 Weeks 5 to 8 Weeks 9 to 12\n3 sets of bench press 3 sets of each at 6 RM, 3 sets of each at\nLinear and leg press at 8 RM 3 days per week 4 RM, 3 days per\nPeriodization (rep max), 3 days per week\nweek\nDay 1 Day"

Therefore, by only training one rep range for\nlong periods of time, you may fail to activate other “pathways” for muscle\nand strength gain.\nSo, should you reprogram your training to ensure you’re rotating\nthrough rep ranges every week? Not necessarily.\nRemember—the participants in the study we just reviewed only did\ntwo exercises: The bench press and leg press. Most workout routines will\ninvolve more exercises, and unless you’re following a fairly high-frequency\n178 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\npowerlifting program, you won’t be doing the same exercises more than\nonce or twice per week.\nFor example, in the first week of the five-day routine of the Beyond\nBigger Leaner Stronger program, you bench press on day one (usually\nMonday), military press on day three (usually Wednesday), and incline\nbench press on day five (usually Friday).\nIf you were to follow the same daily undulating periodization plan as\nin the above study, you’d"

You’re changing your exercises as well as your intensity and rep\nranges, which adds complexity to your programming and is unlikely\nto improve your results.\nThe point of varying your rep ranges is to stimulate your muscles\nin different ways. You can accomplish the same thing with different\nexercises, but doing both at the same time is overkill.\nAs a general rule, I want my programming to be as simple as possi-\nble (or no more complicated than it needs to be), and changing\nrep ranges, intensities, and exercises throughout the week adds\nan unnecessary layer of complexity.\n2. Some exercises don’t lend themselves to high- or low-rep training.\nFor example, most people find that anything above ten reps on the\ndeadlift with heavy weight is grueling, if not dangerous, but not\non the bench press. Similarly, a heavy set of five reps of dumbbell\nside raises is all kinds of awkward, whereas heavy biceps curling\nis perfectly viable.\nThe “More for Less” Method of Maximum Muscle Gain 179\nDumbbell exercises also rarely jibe with low rep ranges.

Once upon a time, before steroids, body-\nbuilders wanted to look like athletes in their prime or ancient warriors, not\nhulking mountains of anabolic-infused muscle.\nFor example, check out Eugen Sandow again from the late 1800s, before\ntestosterone was synthesized:\nSmall and fat by today’s bodybuilding standards, but his physique was\noutstanding in terms of overall muscularity, proportions, and body fat levels,\nand represents the pinnacle of what most natural bodybuilders can hope\nfor. And that’s okay with most guys, who would pike a pod of baby seals to\nlook like Eugen.\nAnother good example is the bodybuilding pioneer Otto Arco, who\nachieved this in the early 1900s:\nHow to Build the Mathematically Ideal Male Physique 189\nAnd finally, here’s George Hackenschmidt, a contemporary of Sandow\nand Arco (and the inventor of the barbell bench press):\n190 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nThese men couldn’t just dial up their doses of #dedication to gain\nendless muscle, so instead, they pursued the ideal relationship between\nsize and symmetry and became literal embodiments of the essence of male\nbeauty—the right balance of overall muscular development, proportion,\nand definition.\nWhat’s more, nothing they did is out of reach for the average guy. While\nyou and I can’t forge our bodies into carbon copies of Eugen’s, Otto’s, or\nGeorge’s, we can get to their level through enough hard work and patience.\nAnd that’s what this chapter is all about—a deep dive into what creates\nthat look and how to get there. It’s far simpler than you might think, too.\nThe key to it all is the application of a mathematical relationship known as\nthe Golden Ratio.\nThe Golden Ratio and the Ideal Male Body\nAfter spending most of his life constructing siege weapons, fortresses,\nand camps to support Julius Caesar’s campaigns across Europe, the architect,\nauthor, and engineer Marcus Vitruvius published the book De Architectura.\nIt’s since become one of the most important sources"

In fact, he claimed\nthe human body corresponded to the hidden geometry of the universe itself\nand thus was a microcosmic representation of the physical realm.\nOver fifteen hundred years later, sometime around 1487, Leonardo da\nVinci drew the human figure per Vitruvius’ observations and named it the\nVitruvian Man. Like Vitrivius, da Vinci was fascinated with human anatomy\nand believed that “man is a model of the world.”\nThe Vitruvian Man would become an exemplar of perfect male propor-\ntions, and researchers would later discover that its balance and beauty\nHow to Build the Mathematically Ideal Male Physique 191\nstemmed from its expression of a mathematical relationship known as the\nDivine Proportion or Golden Ratio.\nEuclid first defined the Golden Ratio in his tour de force Elements,\npublished in 300 BC. The concept is simple: two quantities are in the Golden\nRatio if the ratio of the sum of the quantities to the larger quantity is equal\nto the ratio of the larger quantity to the smaller one.\nVisually, it looks like this:\nAnd numerically, it’s expressed like this: 1:1.618 (1 to 1.618). In the case\nof the above image, b is 1 unit long, and a is 1.618 units long.\nThe fascinating thing about the Golden Ratio is it isn’t an abstract\nthought experiment—it appears to be a natural law. Scientists have found\nit everywhere in nature, including the arrangement of branches along\nthe stems of plants and in the veins of leaves, the skeletons of animals\nand disposition of their veins and nerves, and the composition of chemi-\ncal compounds and the geometry of crystals.

Researchers have recently\nreported the ratio present even at the subatomic level.1\nNowhere is the Golden Ratio more exemplified than in the human body,\nhowever. The face, for instance, abounds with examples of the ratio. The\nhead forms a golden rectangle with the eyes at its midpoint. The mouth and\nnose are each placed at golden distances between the eyes and the bottom\nof the chin. The spatial relationship of the teeth and construction of the ear\neach reveal the ratio, too.\nWe also find the Golden Ratio in the overall proportions of the human\nbody, the different lengths of the finger bones, the makeup of the feet and\ntoes, and even the structure of DNA.\n192 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nAdditionally, as da Vinci observed so long ago, the more the body\nembraces the Golden Ratio, the more beautiful it’s perceived to be. And so\nfor centuries, artists used it to design more appealing figures, while more\nrecently, plastic surgeons and cosmetic dentists have used it to create more\nattractive faces and mouths.\nThe Golden Ratio is useful for our purposes, too. By adjusting the size\nof various body parts in relation to others to align with this ratio, we can\nimprove our visual attractiveness. This isn’t a new concept, either. Eugen\nSandow was the first person to popularize this approach to bodybuilding,\nand he used it to build one of the most impressive physiques of his time.\nSandow was renowned for his resemblance to classical Greek and\nRoman sculptures, which were celebrated for their portrayal of the ideal\nmale body—a small waist that expands upward into a broad, muscular chest\nand shoulders, balanced by a pair of powerful legs.\nFor instance, here’s Sandow doing his best impression of Glykon’s\nstatue of Hercules, which depicted the apogee of physical perfection among\nthe ancient Greeks:\nThis striking resemblance was no accident. Sandow measured the\nstatues in museums he aspired to look like and found they had certain\nHow to Build the Mathematically Ideal Male Physique 193\nproportions between body parts in common.

From this observation,\nSandow developed a blueprint for the perfect physique, which he called\nthe “Grecian Ideal.”\nAlthough he didn’t know it, his system revolved around the Golden\nRatio, and it later served as a model for future bodybuilders who became\nknown for their proportions, like Steve Reeves, Frank Zane, Serge Nubret,\nBob Paris, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.\nSo what is this system? And how can it help us look like a Greek sculp-\nture, too?\nIt starts with establishing reference points—parts of the body that’ll\ndetermine how large other parts should be to achieve a pleasing whole.\nSome of these points, such as the wrist and knee circumference, don’t\nchange in size as you age or gain or lose body fat or muscle. Others, such\nas the waist, do.\nFor example, by measuring your wrist size, you can establish how\nlarge your upper arms should be, and from that measurement how big\nyour calves should be. Your knee size determines how large your upper\nlegs should be, and your waist size tells you how broad your chest and\nshoulders should be.\nIn other words, the recipe for the ideal male physique is a set of simple,\nformulaic relationships between body parts, starting with …\n1. Your flexed arms should be 150 percent larger than the\ncircumference of your non-dominant wrist (wrist circumference\nx 2.5).\nTo measure the smallest part of your wrist, find the bony lump on the\noutside of it (the styloid process), open your hand, and wrap a tape measure\naround the space between that lump and your hand.\nAnd to measure your flexed arms, wrap the tape around the largest part\nof them (the peak of your biceps and middle of your triceps).\nSome people say you should only measure your non-dominant arm, but\nI like to measure both for more accuracy. This also helps you identify any\nmuscle imbalances between your right and left arms.\n194 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nTake these measurements under normal conditions, too (without\na pump or carb loading to increase your muscle size).

Otherwise, your\nnumbers won’t reflect your everyday level of muscularity, which is what\nmatters most, not how you look for the thirty minutes following a workout\nor large meal.\nSome people also say this wrist-to-arm ratio applies to an unflexed\narm—not flexed—but I disagree. My wrist circumference is 7 inches,\nwhile my arms are 17 inches flexed and 14.5 inches unflexed, and they look\nbalanced compared to my chest and shoulders. If I were to assume this ratio\nrefers to an unflexed arm, however, my arms would have to swell to about\n17 inches unflexed and 20+ inches flexed, which would look ridiculous and\nrequire copious steroid use.\nSo, even if you lack a prominent biceps peak, stick with flexed\nmeasurements.\n2. Your flexed calves should match your flexed arms.\nTo measure a flexed calf, raise your heel, press your toes into the\nground, and wrap a measuring tape around the largest part of the muscle.\n3. Your shoulder circumference should measure 1.618 times\nlarger than your waist (waist circumference x 1.618).\nThis produces the coveted V-taper that scientific research has proven\nto be attractive to women.2\nTo measure your waist circumference, circle your waist with a measur-\ning tape at your natural waistline, which is above your belly button and\nbelow your rib cage.

If all you did was prep the\nmeals that are hardest to control in terms of calories (lunch and dinner,\nusually), for instance, it can help with compliance.\n3. Don’t use your plan to experiment with new recipes.\nWhen creating your meal plan, stick with recipes you know and make\noften. This prevents wasted time and money on ones that don’t pan out.\nIf you want to expand your culinary repertoire, do it outside your plan-\nning and prepping. For example, you can leave a couple of dinner slots open\neach week to try new recipes to consider including in your plan.\n4. Choose simple “prep-friendly” recipes.\nDon’t opt for recipes that take considerable time, skill, and money to\nmake; that don’t store and reheat well; or that are hard to quantify nutritionally.\nAlso, remember that in cooking, more—ingredients, steps, or time—\nisn’t always better. A simple recipe made well beats a fancy recipe executed\npoorly every time (and if you want some of my favorite simple and fitness-\nfriendly recipes, check out my cookbook The Shredded Chef).\nThis is why the best meal prep recipes are easy and fast to make, require\nfew ingredients, and allow you to prepare large amounts of food with mini-\nmal equipment and work. One-pot recipes are particularly good for this.\n5. Choose foods that reheat well.\nWhen you reheat food regularly, you quickly learn what does and\n212 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\ndoesn’t do well the second time around.

Some of my favorite “safe choices”\nare soups, casseroles, chicken dishes, rice and other grains, veggie\nmedleys, and ground beef.\nFoods I avoid when prepping are those that don’t microwave well, like\neggs, baked goods, and steak.\nHow to Meal Prep in 4 Simple Steps\nAs for the procedure itself, meal prepping has four steps:\n1. Choosing your prep days\n2. Grocery shopping\n3. Cutting, cooking, and storing\n4. Reheating\nLet’s discuss each.\n1. Choosing your prep days\nHow long you’ll need to prep will depend on your meal plan, but it shouldn’t\ntake more than a few hours per week to cut, cook, and store everything.\nIf you’re going to prep one day per week, I recommend Sundays,\nbecause it helps ensure your food isn’t funky by Thursday or Friday. If\nyou’re going to split it into two sessions, I prefer Sundays and Wednesdays,\nbut the key is choosing days that are roughly equidistant.\n2. Grocery shopping\nTo shop efficiently, create an organized grocery list by determin-\ning what you need to buy for the week and arranging the list by store\nThe Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger Diet Plans 213\ndepartments in the order you’ll visit them. This will streamline your shop-\nping by allowing you to take just one trip down each aisle.\nHere are the categories I separate my shopping list into:\n• Fruits\n• Vegetables\n• Meat, poultry, and fish\n• Milk, yogurt, cheese, and eggs\n• Bread, cereal, rice, pasta, dry beans, and nuts\n• Fats, oils, and sweets\n• Staples, condiments and miscellaneous foods (spices, baking\npowder, etc.)\n• Health and beauty products\n• Household items (laundry soap, light bulbs, etc.)\nAnother option—the most convenient of all—if you don’t mind the\nadded expense, is a delivery service like Instacart or Amazon Prime Now.\n3. Cutting, cooking, and storing\nThe goal here is to prepare and organize everything so it’s easy and conve-\nnient to transport and eat. Here are some tips that’ll help you accomplish this:\n• Begin your prep as you put your groceries away"

Here are some tips that’ll help you accomplish this:\n• Begin your prep as you put your groceries away. This is an\neasy way to save time.\n• Use a food scale to ensure your calories and macros are\naccurate. Weigh before cooking to determine calories and macros\nand after to determine portions, because weights can change with\ncooking. For example, if you need to cook a pound (454 grams) of\nchicken for four meals, first weigh it raw, cook it, and then divide\nit into four equal portions. The chicken won’t add to 454 grams\nafterward because of moisture lost during cooking.\n214 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\n• Do all your washing, cutting, and chopping in one go, then\nmove on to cooking and storing. This is faster than repeating\nthe process meal by meal.\n• You don’t have to cook everything if you prefer to eat certain\nfoods fresh. For instance, some people like to trim their meats\nof fat and chop their veggies, and then store them in bags raw\n(freezer or fridge, depending on when they’ll be cooked) for quick\nstir-fry dinners.\n• Roast different vegetables with the same cooking time\ntogether. Some vegetables cook quickly, like asparagus, mush-\nrooms, and cherry tomatoes, while others take longer, like carrots,\ncauliflower, and potatoes. You can save time by pairing your veggies\nup based on cooking times.\n• Don’t underestimate the utility of protein-rich snacks.\nHigh-protein snacks like Icelandic skyr or Greek yogurt, beef (or\nanother lean meat) jerky, and protein bars are perfect for on-the-go\neating and beating the midday munchies.\n• Cook your meat and fish three different ways in the same\npan. Just because you’ll eat chicken, beef, or fish every day doesn’t\nmean it has to be the same. Use aluminum foil to create dividers in\nyour pan and you can make three flavors at once.\n• Make hardboiled eggs in the oven.

Hardboiled eggs are a\nperfect meal prep food—they’re easy to make, tasty and nutri-\ntious, and can be added to different meals like salads, sandwiches,\nand pasta, or eaten plain. The problem, though, is you can only fit\na handful of eggs in a pot, and making several batches can take\nquite a bit of time. Avoid this by baking the eggs in a muffin tin. To\ndo this, heat your oven to 350 degrees F, load the tin up with eggs\n(shells intact), bake for 30 minutes, and then place the eggs in a\nlarge bowl of ice water for about 10 minutes.\n• Get compartmented containers for separating your meals.\nThese are perfect for keeping your protein, starches, veggies, etc.\nseparate for better reheating, and they’re easy to clean and store.\nThe Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger Diet Plans 215\n• Prevent “mindless eating” with “micro-portioning.” When you\nhave a big bag of goodies in your lap, it’s hard to stop with a handful.\nTherefore, if your meal plan contains small edibles like pretzels, nuts,\nor fruit, store them in smaller containers, jars, or little bags.\n• Use Mason jars to store your salads. If you’ve tried to mix a\nsalad and eat it later, you know the problem: it turns into a soggy\nmush. Mason jars are a perfect one-container solution. Put the\ndressing at the bottom of the jar along with other wet ingredients\nlike fruit, then layer in the sturdier ingredients, and save the greens\nfor the top, and you have a fresh salad on demand. Pack a paper\ntowel at the very top if you’re storing the salad for several days.\n4. Reheating\nSome meals are far better fresh, but when reheated properly, many\nwon’t lose much of their pizzazz in round two.\nHere are three easy tips for better reheating:\n• Drizzle water on top. Flick some water on the food to prevent the\nmoisture from being sucked out of it during heating (this is often\nwhy microwaved food is dry and rubbery).\n• Don’t microwave everything.

Microwaving is better suited for\nsome foods than others, depending on moisture levels. Foods that\nare consistently moist throughout, like rice, vegetables, and soups,\nmicrowave well. Foods that aren’t, like those that are crisp on the\noutside but moist on the inside (like grilled steak), don’t. When\nthe microwave isn’t ideal, opt for an oven or toaster oven instead.\nBroiling can be particularly effective (just keep a close eye on it to\nprevent burning).\n• Don’t “set it and forget it.” If you pop a meal in the microwave\nfor a few minutes straight, it’ll cook unevenly. Instead, after the first\nminute or so, remove the dish, give it a stir, and resume cooking.\n216 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nThat’s it for effective meal prepping, which will make your meal plans\neasier to follow and more enjoyable and enhance your long-term results\non the program.\nMini-Cuts\nA reasonable strategy for mini-cutting is four weeks of dieting after\nevery four months of lean bulking. Basically, once you’ve mostly lost your\nabs, you start your cut.\nIf you gain fat fairly easily, however, you may need to do a mini-cut after\nevery three months of lean bulking, and if you don’t, you may be able to go as\nlong as five or six months of lean bulking before having to cut. Likewise, if you\nlose fat slowly, you may need to cut for up to six weeks before starting your\nnext lean bulk, and if you lose fat quickly, you may only need three weeks.\nIf, however, you’re going into a deficit after just two months or less\nof lean bulking, you’re shooting yourself in the foot, because that’s not\nenough time to make an appreciable amount of progress. And if your cuts\nare regularly stretching beyond six weeks, you’re not following a mini-cut\nstrategy but are just lean bulking and cutting.\nYou also need to ensure you don’t get impatient and try to lose too\nmuch fat too quickly when executing a mini-cut.

For instance, sometimes\npeople try to cram four weeks of fat loss into two weeks, because they want\nto spend as much time in a surplus as possible or have too much fat to lose\nfor four weeks of dieting. Don’t do that.\nThe key is to be aggressive but not reckless in your mini-cuts, so you\nlose as much fat and as little muscle as possible.\nIntermittent Fasting\nAs you know, intermittent fasting isn’t going to magically help you\ngain muscle, lose fat, or get healthy faster than traditional dieting. The\nThe Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger Diet Plans 217\nprimary reason to do it is to increase dietary compliance.\nIn other words, if intermittent fasting helps you regulate your calorie\nand macronutrient intake better, and you enjoy it, it’s worthwhile. If it\ndoesn’t or you don’t, it’s not.\nAnd so, if you’ve never tried intermittent fasting and suspect you may\nlike it, or if you already know it works well for you, this section will show\nyou how to do it correctly.\nThere are four steps:\n1. Choose a protocol.\n2. Calculate your calories and macros.\n3. Create a meal plan.\n4. (Optional) Train while fasted.\nLet’s look at each.\n1. Choose a protocol.\nIntermittent fasting has taken off in recent years, and there are several\npopular options to pick from, including Leangains, Eat Stop Eat, The\nWarrior Diet, and alternate-day fasting. There are many others, but they’re\noften just derivatives of these.\nInstead of reviewing each of the prevailing programs, I’ll just get to the\npoint: the Leangains method is the droid you’re looking for.\nIt was designed by author and powerlifter Martin Berkhan for weightlifters\nand people who care about their body composition, and is why intermittent fast-\ning has gained so much traction in the bodybuilding scene. It’s also my favorite\nout of the bunch because it’s simple, effective, and doesn’t involve long fasts.\nIt’s also one of the few forms of intermittent fasting that has been proven\nto work in scientific research, as you read about in chapter eight.1\nAt bottom, Leangains involves fasting for "

So, for example, if you eat your last meal at\n9 p.m. at night, you won’t eat your next meal until 1 p.m. the following day.\nAs you can see, Leangains more or less boils down to “skip breakfast,”\nwhich many people like to do, anyway.\nWhile fasting, you’re not allowed to have any calories, but black coffee,\nzero-calorie sweeteners, diet soda, and sugar-free gum are permitted. It’s\nalso recommended that you maintain a consistent fasting and feeding\nschedule, because it’ll help minimize hunger while you fast.2\n2. Calculate your calories and macronutrients.\nYou may have heard you don’t have to watch your calories or macros\nwith intermittent fasting, but this isn’t true.3 No matter what type of diet\nyou follow, regulating your calories and macros is crucial.\nAs far as calculating your calories and macros goes, nothing in the\nprinciples or methods taught in Bigger Leaner Stronger changes when\nyou’re following an intermittent fasting protocol. You still work out your\nbasal metabolic rate, total daily energy expenditure, and daily calorie and\nmacro targets. The only difference is you’ll eat on a new schedule.\n3. Create a meal plan.\nIf controlling your calories and macros is still important when doing\nintermittent fasting, then following a meal plan still is as well.\nIn practice, the only significant difference between intermittent fasting\nand traditional meal plans is larger meals, because you’re compressing your\ncalories into fewer feedings.\nIf you’d like to see several examples of well-designed intermittent fast-\ning meal plans for building muscle and losing fat, download the free bonus\nmaterial that comes with this book (www.bblsbook.com/bonus).\nThe Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger Diet Plans 219\n4.

(Optional) Train while fasted.\nYou don’t have to do this (you can work out after breaking your fast), but\nyou may find it more convenient. For instance, it’s common for those doing\nintermittent fasting to train in the morning and break their fasts afterward\nwith a big post-workout meal.\nMany people also like to combine their fasted training with a few supple-\nments discussed in Bigger Leaner Stronger (caffeine, synephrine, and\nyohimbine) to burn fat faster, and especially “stubborn fat” that clings to\nyour abs and lower back.\nThat’s all there is to getting the most out of intermittent fasting.\nSimple, right?\nCalorie Cycling\nThere are many ways to configure a calorie-cycling meal plan, but\ndepending on your goals, I recommend you rotate between three levels\nof calorie intake:\nA high-calorie day of about 10 percent above maintenance calories\nA low-calorie day of about 20 percent below maintenance calories\nA medium-calorie day of about maintenance calories\nThere are extreme versions of calorie cycling out there that involve\nalternating between very-low and very-high calorie days, but I don’t recom-\nmend these.\nWhile such protocols can work, they’re far more trouble than they’re\nworth and usually produce worse results than the more reasonable, moder-\nate method I’ll teach you here.

Instead of gripping the bar\noverhand, though, you flip your grip around so your palms face you and\nthen press. That’s all there is to it.\nI have two recommendations to make the exercise more comfortable,\nhowever:\nThe Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger Exercises 229\n1. Grip the bar a little wider than you would on the regular bench\npress. This helps prevent elbow discomfort.\n2. Position your hands so the bar is more or less parallel with the “life-\nline” on your palms, and the knuckles of your index fingers point\ntoward the plates. This might seem like an odd position, but it’s more\ncomfortable than placing the bar horizontally across the palms.\nPush Press\nThe push press is basically a standing military press that begins with\na quarter squat to help move the bar upward. As you rise from the squat,\nyou press the bar above you until your arms are locked overhead.\n“So it’s just a sloppy standing military press?” you might be wondering.\nNot quite.\nThe point of the push press is to generate just enough momentum\nto help get the bar off the shoulders and through the first few inches of\nmovement, where it’s most likely to get stuck. From there, your shoulders\nand arms do all the work.\nThis allows you to use heavier weights than with the standing military\npress without reducing range of motion much.\nA downside to the push press, though, is it’s hard to judge your progress\n230 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nif you don’t duplicate the boost rep to rep, set to set, and workout to work-\nout.

If you often squat differently, your weights might go up, but your\nshoulders and arms might do less work.\nThe push press also makes it easier to “cheat” by giving the bar more\nof a boost than necessary, reducing the effectiveness of the exercise. That\nsaid, with practice you’ll standardize the force generated by your squats,\nand you’ll realize when you’re helping a little more than you should.\nAs for how to do the push press, set up the same way you do for the\nstanding military press, and instead of immediately pushing the bar straight\nup, drop your butt three to six inches, and then shoot your hips upward as\nexplosively as you can.\nOnce you reach the top of the hip thrust, keep your heels on the ground\nand push the bar up with your arms. Keep pushing until your elbows are\nlocked overhead.\nThen, lower the bar back to the top of your shoulders as you would in\na military press (some people like to bend their knees again to “catch” the\nbar as it descends), take a breath, and you’re ready for the next rep.\nMachine Rear Delt Fly\nThe machine rear delt fly is an exercise that mimics the same motion as\nthe dumbbell rear delt fly, but it’s performed sitting upright on a machine.\nTo do it, sit down on the machine with your chest facing the pad, and\nif possible, adjust the length of the machine’s arms so your elbows are\nslightly bent with your chest on the pad.

Then, return your hands to their starting place for\nyour next rep.\nTrap-Bar Deadlift\nThe trap-bar—or hex-bar—deadlift is one of the few back exercises that\nrivals the conventional deadlift. In fact, although they look different at first\nglance, they’re far more similar than most people realize.2\nBoth exercises do a phenomenal job of training your lower-back, glutes,\nand hamstrings, although the conventional deadlift puts more stress on the\nlower-back and hamstrings, and the trap-bar deadlift puts more stress on\nthe quads. You can think of the trap-bar deadlift as a “squattier” version of\nthe conventional deadlift.\nMost people find it more comfortable, too, because it puts your back\nin a more upright position and your knees and ankles flex a little more,\nbut otherwise, it’s biomechanically identical to the conventional deadlift.3\nAdditionally, most people can lift around 5 to 10 percent more on the trap-\nbar deadlift, which allows you to use maximally heavy weights. Some people\ndismiss this as merely evidence that the trap-bar deadlift is a “deadlift-with-\ntraining-wheels”—an exercise to help newbies learn how to pull properly.\nThis is wrongheaded. While it’s true the trap-bar deadlift is “easier” in\nthat it allows you to lift more weight, you can make it just as hard as the\nconventional deadlift by … wait for it … lifting more weight.\nSo, if you can conventionally deadlift, let’s say, 300 pounds, and you then\ntrap-bar deadlift 330 pounds, both will help you gain muscle and strength\nalmost equally.\nMost people also enjoy the neutral grip of the trap-bar deadlift more and\ncan better keep the weight balanced over the midfoot while maintaining\nstability and strength throughout the entire movement.\nI like to switch from the conventional to the trap-bar deadlift every other\nmacrocycle to give the hips, back, knees, and shoulders (if you use a mixed\ngrip) a break and to keep your training interesting.\n232 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nAs for how to do the trap-bar deadlift, load up the trap-bar and position\nyour feet about shoulder-width apart inside the"

You\nhave two options here: You can grip the “high handles,” which reduces\nrange of motion, or you can grip the “low handles,” which gives the exercise\nthe same range of motion as the conventional deadlift. Pick whichever is\nmore comfortable for you, and stick with it workout to workout.\nThe rest of the exercise is the same as the conventional deadlift—flat-\nten your back, pull your shoulder blades “back and down” (a good cue for\nthis is to “crush oranges in your armpits”), grip the handles as hard as you\ncan, and stand up. Reverse the motion to return the weight to the floor, and\nyou’re ready for the next rep.\nSumo Deadlift\nThe sumo deadlift is like a conventional deadlift, except instead of\nplacing your feet inside your arms, you place them outside your arms,\nlike this …\nThe Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger Exercises 233\nFor most people, this means positioning their feet about twice as\nwide as they would for a conventional deadlift. Aside from your foot\nplacement, there are three other key differences between the sumo\nand conventional deadlift:\n1. Your toes will point out to the side more.\n2. Your hands will likely grip the bar closer together.\n3. Your hips will be closer to the bar when you begin the movement.\nSome people say the sumo deadlift is easier than the conventional\ndeadlift (“cheating”), because the bar travels about 20 percent less. Studies\nshow it produces about the same amount of total muscle activation as the\nconventional deadlift, however.4 The sumo deadlift trains your quads more,\nwhile the conventional deadlift places more strain on your back muscles.5\nPractically, the differences between sumo and conventional deadlifting\nare too small to say one is better than the other for gaining muscle and\nstrength.

The latter is easier to learn for most people, however, and that’s\nwhy I don’t recommend sumo deadlifting unless you’re an experienced\nweightlifter (or conventional deadlifting is too uncomfortable for you).\nLike with the trap-bar deadlift, the main reason to include the sumo\ndeadlift in your workout programming is to give your back a break from\nmonths of heavy conventional pulling.\nAs for how to do the sumo deadlift, you start by positioning your feet\nabout six to twelve inches wider than your shoulders, with your toes pointed\nout by about twenty-five degrees. Next, lean over and grip the bar with\nyour hands directly underneath your shoulders (usually a bit closer than\nyou would grip the bar during the conventional deadlift). You can use a\ndouble-overhand, hook, or mixed grip, but I recommend you start with\nthe first two and only use a mixed grip with your heaviest loads if you’re\nstruggling to hold on to the bar.\nThen, drop your butt, letting your knees bend slightly while staying in\nline with your feet, and keep your back straight.\nIf you have trouble doing this without bending your back, you may need\n234 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nto adjust the width of your stance and the angle of your feet. There’s a lot\nof room for individual variation here—some people with shorter legs and\nstiffer hips like their feet just outside of their arms in a “squat” position,\nand others with longer legs and more flexible hips like their feet so wide\nthey’re almost touching the plates in a “split” position.\nNo matter where you put your feet, though, your shins should be verti-\ncal when you pull, which is little more than taking a deep breath and stand-\ning up. Here are a few cues that’ll help:\n• Spread the floor apart with your feet.\n• Keep your chest up.\n• Pull your butt down to the bar.\n• And once again, crush those oranges in your armpits.\nOne difference you’ll notice with the sumo deadlift is it’s much harder\nto get the bar off the floor but easier to lock out than with the conventional\ndeadlift.

You’re more likely to get stuck on the first half of the lift (“breaking\nthe floor”) when pulling sumo, whereas the second half (“lockout”) is the\nsticking point when pulling conventional.\nA key to powerful sumo deadlifting, then, is ripping the bar off the floor\nas hard as you can. If you get through the first six to eight inches of the\nascent, you’re almost guaranteed to finish the rep.\nYou’ll also notice when pulling sumo that any motion of the bar away\nfrom you (forward) throws your balance off. Thus, you must keep the bar\nmoving straight up and down to sumo deadlift successfully. This makes the\nbar rub against your shins and thighs, so to protect yourself from road rash,\nyou can wear pants, shin guards, or knee sleeves (my preferred method).\nTo reset for your next rep, let the bar descend in a straight line, revers-\ning the movement you just completed. The wrong way to do this, however,\nis dropping the weight to the floor and bouncing into the next rep.\nThis allows you to squeeze a few more reps out of each set, but also\nmakes the exercise easier, partially defeating the purpose, and increases\nthe chances of your form slipping (thus increasing the risk of injury).\nThe Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger Exercises 235\nSo instead, reset the hard way: Lower the bar quickly but under\ncontrol to the ground, check and adjust your setup as needed, and then\nperform your next rep. This is more difficult and makes your sets take a\nlittle longer, but it’s safer and better for improving technique and gaining\nmuscle and strength.\nBarbell Good Morning\nThe barbell good morning is like a Romanian deadlift, except instead\nof holding the bar in your hands, you hold it across your shoulders like a\nback squat.\nIf that looks to you like a brilliant way to snap your spine in half, you’re\nnot alone—many people new to the exercise feel the same way. Despite its\nappearance, however, it’s safe so long as you use proper form.\nMore importantly, it’s also effective—research shows that it can activate\nthe hamstrings almost as well as the barbell deadlift.6\n236 BEY"

Place it across your mid-traps and rear delts, so\nit’s resting right above the little ridges on the back of your shoulder blades\n(the low-bar position). You can also do a high-bar barbell good morning, but\nit’s harder to learn, so I recommend you save it for after you’re comfortable\nwith the low-bar variation.\nNext, grip the bar with either a thumbless (your thumbs resting on top\nof the bar next to your fingers) or a full grip (your thumbs wrapped around\nthe bar). Use whichever grip feels most secure and comfortable to you.\nKeeping your upper back tight, unrack the bar and take a step back\nfrom the squat rack. Then, position your feet about shoulder-width apart,\nlike you’re squatting (or slightly narrower with the toes pointed forward,\nif you find that more comfortable).\nNow comes the tricky part. With your knees mostly straight (slightly\nbent), move your butt backward so your torso can “hinge” forward and\nlower the bar toward the ground in a straight line. Once you can’t lower\nthe bar any further without bending your back (usually when your back is\nat about a twenty-degree angle to the ground), push your butt forward and\nlift the bar with your back simultaneously.\nGood cues for getting the whole movement right are to think of pulling\nthe bar into the top of your feet during the descent and throwing the bar\noff your back during the ascent.\nThe most common mistakes people make with the barbell good morn-\ning are letting their spine bend forward at the bottom of the exercise,\nbending their head backward, and bending their knees too much.\nIf you make any of these mistakes, make sure you’re not using too much\nweight, and work on one point at a time until you correct the flaws.

The downside is it requires a preacher curl bench.\nWhy bother with another type of curl? This one offers two benefits:\n1. It produces slightly more muscle activation than dumbbell and\nbarbell curls, which indicates it’s minimally not inferior to either\n(which many people believe).7\n2. It gives your wrists, elbows, and shoulders a break from dumbbell\nand barbell curling.\nCable Curl\nYes, more biceps!\nThe cable curl has been a staple among bodybuilders and powerlift-\ners for decades: it’s simple, effective, and different from free weights,\nbecause it maintains constant resistance throughout the entire range\nof motion.\nIt’s not as effective as the barbell curl or EZ-bar curl, but there are two\nreasons for including it in your workouts:\n1. It’s easier on your wrists, elbows, and shoulders, which can help\nward off joint aches.\n2. It’s easy to perform correctly when you’re fatigued, which is nice\nlater in a workout when your tank is running low.\nAnother benefit of the cable curl is you can do it in almost every gym,\nwhereas you don’t always have access to barbells, EZ bars, or even heavy\nenough dumbbells.\nAs for how to do the cable curl, find a cable machine that accepts various\n238 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nhandle attachments, and drop the pulley to the bottom position (so you’ll\nbe pulling the weight up).\nYou have a few options for the handle, and I recommend either the\nstraight bar or EZ bar attachment. Some people use a rope, V-bar, or the\ncable itself, but these offer no advantages and can limit your performance\nbecause of discomfort.\nAfter you’ve attached the handle, lean over, grip it with both hands,\nstand up, and take a half step back away from the cable machine to give\nyourself room.

Macrocycles\nEach sixteen-week macrocycle will begin with lighter weights and\nmore reps, and end with heavier weights and fewer reps, culmi-\nnating in a “Strength Week,” where you’ll try to set new personal\nrecords on primary exercises, followed by a deload week.\n2. Mesocycles\nThe Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger Training Plans 243\nEach four-week mesocycle involves three weeks of hard training\nfollowed by a deload week. Similar to the macrocycle, each mesocycle\nbegins with lighter weights and more reps, and moves toward heavier\nweights and fewer reps. This pattern repeats every mesocycle, with\nweights getting heavier as you progress through a macrocycle.\n3.

Training microcycles (three per mesocycle)\n2. Deload microcycles (one per mesocycle)\nAnd that’s it for the basic overview of how the program is periodized.\nLet’s now review the three training routines you can choose from.\nThe Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger\nTraining Routines\nWhereas the different training periods—the macro-, meso-, and micro-\ncycle—determine how your rep ranges and intensities change over the\ncourse of the program, your training routine delineates how often you’ll\ntrain and what you’ll do in each workout.\nIn the program, you have three training routines to choose from: a five,\nfour, or three day. Each is a weekly (seven-day) routine, so the most you\ncan do is five strength workouts per seven days.\nAs far as results go, the five-day routine is better than the four- and\nthree-day routines, and the four-day is better than the three-day. That\ndoesn’t mean you can’t do well with the four- or three-day routines, though.\nAll three training routines can work for cutting, lean bulking, or\n244 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nmaintaining, but if you’re cutting on the five-day routine and begin feeling\nrundown, you may want to switch to one of the other two routines to put\nless stress on your body.\nEvery routine trains each major muscle group one to three times per\nweek, with the upper body receiving more attention than the lower body,\nbecause it takes a lot more work for most guys to get the upper body they\nwant than their ideal lower body.\nTry not to change training routines during a macrocycle, as this can\nalter volume and results. Ideally, you’ll choose one routine and stick with\nit for an entire macrocycle. However, if you’d like to “upgrade” from the\nthree- or four-day routine to the four- or five-day routine in the middle of a\nmacrocycle, give it a go.

(Don’t worry, we’ll talk about the\n“Strength Weeks” and deloads soon.)\nYou may have also noticed you don’t increase your weights in a perfectly\nlinear way.

Do\nyou feel you can get that extra rep or two without reaching technical fail-\nure? Or does the weight feel too heavy today and you’ll have to try again\nnext time?\nOn one hand, this makes planning your training as easy as scrambling\nan egg. You work in a rep range until you hit the top of it for a number of\nsets and then you add weight. That’s it. No spreadsheets required.\nWhere this can work against you, however, is when the weights get\nheavy on your primary exercises and your workouts get hard. It’s difficult\nto stay motivated to keep pushing your limits voluntarily. Instead, you’ll\nadvance when you feel great and retreat when you don’t, resulting in a lot\nof work for little ground gained.\nHere’s the rub, though: how tough a set or workout feels often has\nlittle bearing on how well we can perform, because how our training feels\nisn’t merely a reflection of how physically capable we are of working out.\nThere are powerful psychological factors in play as well, something you’ve\nundoubtedly experienced. (Ever step into the gym feeling crappy and\nexpecting a horrible workout, only to be pleasantly surprised by your\nperformance?)\nThe point is, assuming we’ve been eating and sleeping well, we can\noften accomplish more in our workouts than our minds would have us\nbelieve.\nLinear progression allows us to tap into this potential, regardless of\nhow we feel in the moment. We won’t hit every set, and sometimes we will\nhave to take one step back before we can take two forward, but more often,\nwe’ll be impressed by how well we did despite “feeling off.”\nAccessory exercises are another story, though.

Not only are they less\nchallenging than primary exercises, they aren’t as important, either. Thus,\nwhy do the extra work required to use linear progression when you can do\nequally well with double progression?\n254 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nLinear Progression in Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger\nOn the program, you’ll keep track of your one-rep maxes for your\nprimary exercises and use these numbers to calculate how much weight\nto lift in every workout.\nFor example, my bench press one-rep max is about 275 pounds, so if a\nworkout calls for 75 percent of one-rep max for 8 reps, I multiply 275 by 75\npercent to get 206.25, which I would round down to 205 pounds on the bar.\nI would then go for 8 reps with 205, regardless of how I felt or how\nthe weight felt (light or heavy). I may not get the 8 reps (more on this in a\nminute), but I’d have to try.\nThis means for your average training weights to go up macrocycle to\nmacrocycle (progressive overload), your one-rep maxes must go up. If\nthey don’t, average training weights will stagnate (along with your results).\nTherefore, the program includes a Strength Week at the end of each\nmacrocycle, where you test your strength on primary exercises to see if\nyou’ve gotten stronger over the course of the macrocycle.\nHere’s how the Strength Week workouts look:\nSet Intensity Reps\n1 95 percent of one-rep max As many reps as possible\nPrimary\nExercise 1 2 85 percent of one-rep max 4\n1 95 percent of one-rep max As many reps as possible\nPrimary\nExercise 2\n2 85 percent of one-rep max 4\n1 1 rep in reserve 6 to 8\nAccessory\nExercise 1\n2 1 rep in reserve 6 to 8\n1 1 rep in reserve 6 to 8\nAccessory\nExercise 2\n2 1 rep in reserve 6 to 8\nAs you can see, the primary differences on"

Your workouts entail two sets for each primary and accessory exer-\ncise instead of four (half of the normal workout volume).\nThe Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger Training Plans 255\n2. Two of the sets call for as many reps as possible (AMRAP) with 95\npercent of one-rep max and ending at technical failure (not absolute\nfailure), followed by a back-off set, which involves doing 4 reps with\n85 percent of one-rep max before moving on to the next exercise.\nYou’re probably also wondering about reps in reserve (RIR). If you’re\nlike most experienced weightlifters, this is how you talk about your training.\nAfter a set of hard barbell curls, for instance, you might say, “Man, that was\na grinder—I had maybe one rep left in the tank.”\nIn other words, RIR is how we naturally express how hard a set feels,\nand research shows it’s an accurate way to track how close we are to failure.1\nAnd so in the case of the Strength Week workouts, you’ll take each set\nof accessory exercises to the point where you feel you can do one more\ngood rep before your form breaks down (one RIR).\nWhy the AMRAP sets? Based on how many reps you get in these\nsets, you can then update your one-rep maxes for each of the primary\nexercises and use those new estimates for programming your next\nmacrocycle.\nFor example, let’s say you begin a macrocycle with a squat one-rep\nmax of 315 pounds, and in the Strength Week, get 4 reps with 300 pounds\n(95 percent of 315). Plug that into the one-rep max calculator available\nat www.bblsbook.com/1RM and in my free workout app Stacked (www.\ngetstackedapp.com), and you’ll get your new approximate one-rep max of\n327 pounds, which you can then use to determine your new training weights\nfor your next macrocycle.\nWhy AMRAP with 95 percent versus one rep with 100 percent or even\n105 percent, as"

Because a true one-rep max\nattempt is time-consuming, risky, and exhausting.\n• To test your true max, you need to train with lighter weights and\nlower volumes for several days to a week beforehand to make sure\nyou’re rested.\n• You then have to push yourself very close to absolute muscular\n256 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nfailure, which means your technique is likely to falter and the risk\nof injury is higher.\n• It leaves you feeling drained for at least a few days. Some advanced\nweightlifters say it takes one to two weeks until they feel normal\nagain after a one-rep max test on the squat and deadlift.\nSo most of the time, true one-rep max tests are inappropriate. Instead,\nwe can just use equations to predict our one-rep maxes based on how many\nreps we can get with lighter weights.\nAll right, that’s it for Strength Week programming. Let’s touch on one\nmore important aspect of linear progression in the program.\nWhat If You Miss Reps in Sets of Primary Exercises?\nAs I mentioned in the beginning of this section, you should end hard\nsets of primary exercises 1 to 2 reps shy of technical failure, or expressed\ndifferently, at one to two RIR. For most people, this is about 3 to 4 reps shy of\nabsolute muscle failure, so your hard sets should be hard, but not gut-busting.\nYou want to avoid taking sets to technical failure, because it won’t\nincrease muscle and strength gain, often leads to bad form, and if done too\noften, hampers recovery as well.2\nIn practice, this means your goal in every set of primary exercises\n(except AMRAP sets in Strength Weeks) is doing the prescribed number\nof reps without reaching technical failure. And if you feel you can exceed\nthe target without reaching technical failure, don’t. Stop when you reach\nyour rep target.\nWhat’s more likely, however, is failing to hit your target without reach-\ning technical failure (or at all).\nFor me, this usually occurs in my third"

Stop when you reach\nyour rep target.\nWhat’s more likely, however, is failing to hit your target without reach-\ning technical failure (or at all).\nFor me, this usually occurs in my third or fourth set of 8 or 10 reps (and\nless often with heavier weights), and it typically stems from the one-rep max\ncalculations used to determine training weights. While they work well for\nmost people, there’s variability from person to person.\nThe Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger Training Plans 257\nFor instance, if you tell a group of people to get as many reps as they\ncan with 80 percent of a calculated one-rep max, most will get about 8 reps\nbefore reaching absolute failure. However, there’ll always be outliers—\nsome may only get 4 or 5 reps before petering out and others may get 10\nor more.3\nOne factor that heavily influences this is training experience. A one-rep\nmax calculator will say you should be able to get 8 to 10 reps with 80 percent\nof one-rep max, but if you’ve focused on sets of 2 to 3 reps with 90 percent\nof one-rep max for years, you’d probably struggle with this. Likewise, if\nyou’ve mostly done 10 to 12 reps with about 65 percent of one-rep max,\nyou’ll likely be unable to do a set of 2 to 3 reps with 90 percent of one-rep\nmax as a calculator would predict.\nAs you gain experience working in different rep ranges (as you will on\nthe program), however, you’ll find your strength lining up well with the\ncalculated targets. Even so, you can expect to miss rep targets now and\nthen, so let’s talk about how to deal with those scenarios.\nIf you fall short by even one rep on a first or second set of a primary\nexercise, reduce your estimated one-rep max by 10 pounds, and recalculate\nyour training weight.\nFor instance, if my workout calls for 8 reps with 205 pounds on the\nbench press, and on my first set, I get 6 reps, I’d reduce my estimated\none-rep max from 275 to 265 pounds, and recalculate my training weight\nto 198.75 pounds, which I’d"

Maybe you didn’t rest\nenough between sets, or didn’t sleep or eat enough the day before, or maybe\nyou just ended your set too soon.\nIf, however, you miss your reps again on the third or fourth sets the\nnext time you do that workout, chances are the weight is too heavy, forcing\nyou to take your first and second sets too close to failure.\n258 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nHere, decrease your estimated one-rep max by 10 pounds, and recalcu-\nlate your training weights as needed until you don’t miss reps on any sets.\nDouble Progression in\nBeyond Bigger Leaner Stronger\nIn addition to linear progression, the program will include double\nprogression, because it’s simple and effective, especially with accessory\nexercises, which don’t require more complex methods of periodization\nand progression.\nHere’s how to implement double progression in the program:\nWhen you reach the top of the prescribed rep range for all four sets\nof an accessory exercise, increase the weight by 10 pounds (total). Then,\nwork with that weight until you can hit the top of the rep range for all four\nsets, move up again, and so on.\nFor example, let’s say you’re doing barbell curls in the 10-to-12-rep\nrange, and you get 12 reps with 90 pounds on all four sets. Great! The next\ntime you do that exercise for 10 to 12 reps, up the weight to 100 pounds and\nuse that until you can get 12 reps for all four sets.\nAnother important element of double progression is how hard your\nhard sets are supposed to be.

If not, how close should you come?\nAs a general rule, end all sets of accessory exercises one rep shy of\ntechnical failure, but you don’t have to adhere to this guideline perfectly.\nAt the beginning of the program, for instance, you may prefer to end\nmost of your accessory sets 2 or 3 reps shy of technical failure as you get\nused to the exercises and rep ranges.\nYou’ll also inadvertently take some of your sets of accessory exercises\nto technical failure now and then, especially as you attempt to move up in\nweight.

Increase the weight in smaller increments.\nMost dumbbells and preloaded barbells advance in increments\nof 10 pounds (5 pounds per dumbbell), and sometimes this is too\nchallenging. To work around this, you can buy a set of 2.5-pound\nmagnetic microplates that attach to the barbells or dumbbells,\nallowing you to move up just 5 pounds total.\nSo, with the curls, this would allow you to move from 90 to 95\npounds, not 100.\n2. Continue with the original, lighter load until you can get four clean\nsets of your rep target.\nOften, when a progression fails to “stick,” it’s because the third\nand fourth sets were sloppy or “grinders,” almost reaching abso-\nlute failure.\nWhen this is the case, an easy fix is to go back to the lighter weight\nand keep working with it until you can get four sets of the top of your\nrep range with good form, ending"

So it’s\neven more important now to ensure you’re resting enough in between sets.\nFor your primary exercises, rest three to five minutes between each\nset, and for accessory exercises, two to three minutes.\nDuring your Strength Weeks, you may want to rest longer between\nyour AMRAP sets—five minutes or even longer, if necessary. As these sets\ninvolve lifting heavy weights for as many reps as possible, it’s worth resting\nan extra minute or three to increase your chances of setting a personal\nrecord. (Plus, you’re doing half the normal sets per workout, so you have\ntime to rest more.)\nHow do you know when you’re ready to do your next hard set?\n1. Your breathing should be back to normal (you should be able to\ntalk comfortably).\n2. Your heart rate should have settled down (it’ll still be elevated, but\nit shouldn’t be racing).\nTry not to rest too long, as well, mostly because it wastes time and\nhurts focus.

Your strongest set is the one that\ninvolved the most weight for the most reps.\nFor example, let’s say your strongest set on the squat in the last two\nmonths was 235 pounds for 6 reps. When you plug that into the one-rep\nmax calculator at www.bblsbook.com/1RM, it estimates your one-rep max\nat 273 pounds.\nGoing back farther than the two-month cutoff increases the likelihood\nof inaccuracy. If you use a set from six months ago, for instance, you might\nbe stronger or weaker now, and thus won’t get a correct estimate of your\ncurrent strength.\nIf you haven’t performed one or more of the primary exercises in the\nlast two months, go back as far as you need to, but keep in mind the weights\nmay need to be adjusted.\nIf you haven’t performed one or more of the primary exercises in a\nvery long time, use trial and error to find a weight you can get 4 to 5 reps\nwith, with 2 or 3 reps in reserve. Then put your best set into the one-rep\nmax calculator, and use the result(s) as your estimated one-rep max(es)\nfor your first macrocycle.\nAlso, the weights may feel a little easy when you first start, but remem-\nber—they will get heavier as you continue on the program, and it’s better\nto err on the side of starting a macrocycle with weights that feel a tad light\nrather than heavy.\nTo find your starting weights for the accessory exercises you’ll be\ndoing in the first macrocycle, review your workout logs and look at the most\nrecent sets in the same rep range of the first mesocycle"

This is normal, and by week two,\nyou should be able to go whole hog on the program.\nThe final scenario to be addressed here is finding your starting weights\non accessory exercises as you move from one mesocycle to the next.\nFor example, in the first mesocycle of a macrocycle, you’ll be working\nin the 10-to-12 rep range on your accessory exercises. Then, in the second\nmesocycle, you’ll be working in the 8-to-10 rep range. How do you deter-\nmine your starting weights for that second mesocycle?\nEasy—just add 10 pounds to the bar, machine, or dumbbells (total, 5\nper side) and you’ll lose 2 or 3 reps.\nSo, for instance, if you wrapped up a mesocycle doing sets of 10 to 12\nreps of one-arm dumbbell rows with 95-pound dumbbells, you’d use 100\npounders in the next mesocycle, which calls for 8 to 10 reps per set.\nHow to Warm Up for Your Workouts\nTo ensure the major muscle groups you’ll train in a workout are warmed\nup and primed for optimum performance, you’ll do several warm-up sets\nwith the first exercises for each muscle group.\nFor instance, let’s say you show up to do a leg workout of squatting, leg\npressing, leg curling, and calf raising, in that order (as you do on the leg\nday of the five-day routine).\nYou’d first warm up on the squat, and then do your hard sets.

The same goes for the leg\ncurls and calf raises—your hamstrings and calves will be more than ready\nafter the squatting and leg pressing.\nIn this way, your warm-up sets for the squat serve as your warm-up\nThe Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger Training Plans 263\nsets for the entire workout.\nLet’s say you were going to do a full-body workout, however, of squat-\nting, leg pressing, incline bench pressing, and barbell curling, in that order\n(as you do on the full-body day of the three-day routine).\nIn this case, you’d warm up on the squat, do your hard sets, followed by\nyour hard sets of the leg press. Then, you’d warm up on the incline bench\npress before doing your hard sets, because squatting and leg pressing\ndoesn’t involve your “push” muscles. Next, you’d move directly into your\nhard sets of barbell curling, because the biceps will be warmed up after\nyour incline bench pressing (the bench press doesn’t train your biceps per\nse, but does stimulate them).\nAs for warming up on an individual exercise, here’s an easy and effec-\ntive routine that’ll get the job done without compromising your perfor-\nmance on your hard sets:\n1. Do 6 reps with about 50 percent of your hard set weight, and rest\nfor a minute.\n2. Do 4 reps with the same weight at a faster pace, and rest for a\nminute.\n3. Do 2 reps with about 70 percent of your hard set weight, and rest\nfor a minute.\nAnd that’s it.

I’m in the middle. I think both methods\n264 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\ncan work, but I lean toward deloading volume for two reasons:\n1. Studies show that reducing volume instead of intensity is more\neffective for decreasing fatigue, which is the main goal of a deload.5\n2. Research shows that reducing volume instead of intensity is more\neffective for maintaining performance, which makes it easier to\npick up where you left off when you get back to your hard training.6\nOn the other hand, there are benefits to deloading intensity as well.\n• Reducing intensity in addition to volume helps reduce fatigue even\nmore than reducing volume alone.\n• Reducing intensity helps eliminate any niggling aches, pains, or\nsoreness before you start another stint of hard training.\n• Reducing intensity gives you a mental break and can increase your\nenthusiasm for hitting the heavy weights again.\nFor these reasons, there are two deloads in the program:\n1. The Volume Deload Week\n2. The Full Deload Week\nLet’s review each.\nThe Volume Deload Week\nThis is what it sounds like: a reduction in volume.\nIn a Volume Deload Week, you cut your number of hard sets and reps\nper set in half, but use the same heavy weights as your previous week of\nhard training. If it’s an odd number of reps, round down to an even one\nbefore halving it.\nWith this deload, you’re reducing your number of hard sets and reps\nThe Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger Training Plans 265\nfor the week and staying well away from technical failure, which greatly\nreduces the stress placed on the body.\nFor example, if you did four hard sets of 6 reps of bench pressing with\n80 percent of one-rep max in your third microcycle (week) of a mesocycle,\nin the following Volume Deload Week, you’d warm up and do two sets of\n3 reps with 80 percent of one-rep max.

You could do more or fewer than this number, but five is\nenough to get blood flowing, reinforce proper technique, and keep your\nworkouts short.\nAlthough you might feel rusty after you return from a Full Deload Week\nto start your next macrocycle, don’t let that deter you. It’s a small price to\npay to ensure you’re recovered and ready for more intense training.\nAnother option instead of a Full Deload Week is just taking a week off.\nIf you’re feeling particularly exhausted, sore, or beaten up after a Strength\nWeek, or would just like a week of rest before starting the next macrocycle,\n266 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nit’s fine to stay out of the gym instead of deloading.\nWhat About Cardio?\nYou don’t need to do any cardio on the Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger\nprogram.\nIn fact, if you go about cardio the wrong way—doing too much, at too\nhigh an intensity, or at the wrong times—it may do more harm than good.\nCardio does offer many health and fitness benefits, however, including\nbetter metabolic health, more stamina, significant calorie burning, and\npossibly even faster post"

You can walk on days you train your\nupper body, lower body, or your whole body, and it won’t have any negative\neffect on your recovery or progress.\nFinally, walking burns more calories than most people realize—about\n200 to 400 per hour depending on your bodyweight and pace—and most\nof these calories come from body fat.9\nThat said, you may want to do moderate- or high-intensity cardio while\non the program, and here’s how to do it correctly:\n• Limit these types of cardio workouts to no more than 50 percent of\nthe time you spend weightlifting. If you lift weights for five hours\nper week, don’t do over two and a half hours of moderate- or high-in-\ntensity cardio per week.\nThe Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger Training Plans 267\n• Limit your cardio workouts to no more than thirty to forty-five\nminutes per session.\n• Do your cardio and weightlifting on separate days if possible, and\nif you have to do them on the same day, try to separate them by\nat least six hours to minimize the cardio’s “interference effect” on\nyour weightlifting.10\n• When lifting weights and doing cardio on the same day, try to\nschedule moderate- and high-intensity cardio workouts on days\nwith upper-body training, and low-intensity cardio workouts on\nlower-body days.

A quick chat about supplementation, a quick\nreview of some frequently asked questions, and a quick ask for a quick\nfavor (pretty please?), and we’re off to the squat rack!\nThe Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger Training Plans 269\nKey Takeaways\n• The Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger training plan consists of three\nperiods: sixteen-week macrocycles, four-week mesocycles, and\none-week microcycles.\n• There are also two types of microcycles in the program: training\nmicrocycles (three per mesocycle) and deload microcycles (one\nper mesocycle).\n• All three training routines can work for cutting, lean bulking, or\nmaintaining, but if you’re cutting on the five-day routine and begin\nfeeling rundown, you may want to switch to one of the other two\nroutines to put less stress on your body.\n• Try not to change training routines during a macrocycle, as this\ncan alter volume and results.\n• If you’d like to “upgrade” from the three- or four-day routine to the\nfour- or five-day routine in the middle of a macrocycle, give it a go,\nbut avoid “downgrading,” unless you have to.\n• If you can’t do an exercise for whatever reason, you can replace it\nwith an alternate exercise from the previous chapter, do four more\nsets of an exercise already in your workout, or do more sets of the\nthree exercises you can do for a total of sixteen for the workout.\n• In the Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger program, you’ll utilize weekly\nundulating periodization by reducing your rep targets by 2 reps\neach week for your primary exercises.\n• In the case of accessory exercises, you’ll work in one rep range\nper mesocycle, going from the 10-to-12-rep range to the 8-to-10-rep\nrange and finally the"

I’m glad I took the leap.\nThe primary reason Legion is going gangbusters is our commitment to\ncomplete transparency, from formulating to scientific research, marketing\nand advertising, labeling, and more.

If you sleep fine, however, melatonin won’t benefit you, so there’s\nno need to take it.\nResearch shows that melatonin should be taken 15 to 30 minutes before\nbed and can be taken daily if needed. As for the dosing:\n276 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\n• 300 micrograms (0.3 milligrams) is usually seen as the lowest\neffective dose.\n• 500 micrograms (0.5 milligrams) is also a low effective dose.\n• 1 to 3 milligrams is the most common range with supplements.\nSome people benefit from these doses more than the microgram\namounts, and some don’t.\n• 5 to 10 milligrams has been used to treat sleep impairments unre-\nsponsive to the 1 to 3 milligram range.\n• Megadoses beyond the above, up to 40 milligrams, have been tested\nand appear safe, but aren’t linked to any unique benefits.\nSo, with melatonin, more isn’t necessarily better.

This is most effective at a dose of 3 milligrams and is designed for\npeople (like me) who are light sleepers and wake up several times at night.\nAs for glycine, everyone can safely benefit from it regardless of how\nwell they sleep, and research shows that the clinically effective dose is 3\ngrams taken around 30 minutes before bed.1 It too can be taken daily or\nless frequently, if you prefer.\nLemon balm can also benefit everyone, and research shows that the\nclinically effective dose is between 300 and 1,200 milligrams depending on\nthe rosmarinic acid content (shoot for about 50 milligrams of rosmarinic\nacid per dose) taken around 30 minutes before bed.

For most people, this occurs after one to two\nyears, mostly because it doesn’t provide enough volume for an intermediate\nweightlifter to continue making progress.\nThat said, some find they can follow Bigger Leaner Stronger for three,\nfour, or even five years with consistent muscle and strength gain. If you’re\none of them, you don’t have to switch after a year or two if it’s still working\nfor you, but you might get even better results with Beyond Bigger Leaner\nStronger, and you might enjoy the challenge of more difficult training.\nAnother way of determining when to transition from Bigger to Beyond\nBigger Leaner Stronger is strength levels. If you haven’t hit at least two of\nthe following targets, chances are you can still profit from Bigger Leaner\nStronger and don’t need to switch just yet.\n• Squat One-Rep Max: 1.5 x body weight\n• Bench Press One-Rep Max: 1.2 x body weight\n• Deadlift One-Rep Max: 2 x body weight\n• Overhead Press One-Rep Max: 0.8 x body weight\n• Chin-up or Pull-up: 8 reps with bodyweight or at least 1 rep with\nbodyweight plus 20 percent\nWhy two out of five targets for moving to Beyond Bigger Leaner Stron-\nger? Because it’s normal for people to be above average in a couple of key\nlifts and below average in the others.\nFor instance, I have long legs and arms, so I’ve always struggled with\nthe bench press, overhead press, and squat, but less so on the deadlift,\nbecause the advantage provided by my arms negates the disadvantage of\nmy legs.\nQ: I’m in my 30s/40s/50s-plus.

Be a stickler for good form.\nThe older you are, the less shenanigans you can get away with in your\ntraining. Lumbar rounding in your deadlifts … knee bowing in your squats\n… elbow flaring in your bench presses … they all increase the risk of injury\nat any age, but improper form becomes more dangerous as the years go by.\nHence, my emphasis on learning and using proper form from day one,\nregardless of age or fitness level, and resisting the temptation to sacrifice\nform to hit personal records. I’m willing to train hard, but if I feel my lower-\nback rounding on the deadlift, I end the set. Likewise, if I’m squatting and\nno longer can keep my shoulders rising with my hips, I end the set.\nI’m not a competitive bodybuilder or strength athlete. I enjoy lifting\nheavy weights and being muscular and strong, but I like staying healthy\nand injury-free more. I suspect you’re in the same boat.\n2. Get enough sleep.\nMany middle-aged people don’t sleep enough, because they’ve heard\n(and believed) the common wisdom that sleep needs decline with age. This\nis true, but it doesn’t mean you can get by on minimal shuteye.\nMost of us start out needing about twelve to fourteen hours of sleep\nper night as babies, ten to twelve hours as toddlers, and nine to ten hours\nas teenagers. Once we reach adulthood, we need seven to nine hours\ndepending on our genetics, lifestyle, and exercise habits.2\nSo yes, we need less sleep as we get older, but not that much less.

While\n292 BEYOND BIGGER LEANER STRONGER\nthere is a tiny fraction of the population that can get by with six, five, or even\nfour hours of sleep per night, you’re probably not one of them.3\nWhat’s more, intense training increases your need for sleep, so even if you\ncould make do with six or seven hours per night, you’ll do better with more.\nWhile there’s no direct evidence sleeping more will enhance muscle\nor strength gain, multiple studies have found that increasing sleep dura-\ntion from seven to eight hours per night to nine to ten improves athletic\nperformance in several ways.4 It’s very likely these benefits would extend\nto your workouts as well.\nYour ability to recover from your training will also be directly impacted\nby how much and how well you sleep. Research shows that even slight\nsleep deprivation (sleeping seven hours if your body really needs eight, for\ninstance) may impair muscle protein synthesis, which could reduce muscle\ngrowth if you were regularly underslept.5\nSo, if you’re sleeping less than seven hours per night, you aren’t sleep-\ning enough, and bumping this up by an hour or two will probably produce\nimmediate and long-term benefits inside and outside the gym.\nQ: Why aren’t there any ab exercises on the program?\nA: There are!\nThey’re called: the squat, deadlift, military press, bench press, chin-up,\npull-up, one-arm dumbbell row, and others.\nMy point is while there are no direct ab exercises in the program, like\ncrunches, planks, and situps, many of the compound exercises in it heavily\ntrain your abdominals, obliques, and other core muscles.\nFor instance, a study conducted by scientists at Nord University\nmeasured the core muscle activity of twelve powerlifters and national level\nsprinters during barbell back squats and weighted planks.6\nThe researchers found that on average, the barbell back squat activated\nthe rectus abdominis (“ab muscles”) and external oblique muscles just as\neffectively as the weighted plank and the erector spinae muscles signifi-\ncantly more.

Rectus abdominis activation also increased with each rep of\nFrequently Asked Questions 293\nthe squat, but not the weighted plank.\nThus, the researchers concluded, “ … we recommend targeting core\nmuscles by integrated high-intensity exercises [such] as the squat instead\nof an isolated and isometric core exercise, especially for athletes.”\nWhy did I bother including direct ab exercises in Bigger Leaner\nStronger, then?\nBecause that’s a book for guys who can benefit from ab training. Most\nof the people who read Bigger Leaner Stronger are new to heavy, compound\nweightlifting, and thus have underdeveloped core muscles. While they don’t\nneed to do any ab exercises, including some in their routine will speed up\ntheir core development so they can see their six-packs sooner.\nThis book, however, is for guys who likely don’t need direct ab exer-\ncises. They’ve been squatting, deadlifting, and bench pressing for some\ntime now, and have a well-developed core that won’t benefit from additional\nab work.\nBut if your abdominal development is lagging or you just like doing ab\nexercises, you can include ab exercises in Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger. I\nrecommend adding two sets of ab exercises of your choice (Bigger Leaner\nStronger has my favorites) to the end of your legs and pull days, after you’ve\nfinished all of your prescribed exercises.\nAfter doing this for one macrocycle, you can up the volume to three\nor four sets of each core exercise, but there’s little reason to do more than\nthis when you’re also doing plenty of heavy weightlifting.\nQ: Should I change anything when I’m cutting?\nA: Just your expectations.\nWhile people new to weightlifting can gain muscle and strength while\ncutting, as an intermediate or advanced weightlifter, maintaining most of\nyour gains during a cutting phase is cause for celebration.\nIn the Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger program, if your one-rep maxes\nare about the same or slightly lower than when you started a cut, you’ve\ndone well.\n294 BEYOND BIGGER LE"

Don’t ask me why, but pressing often suffers more\nthan pulling and squatting while cutting.\nIf you lose more strength than that while dieting, you were probably\nrestricting your calories too much, eating too little protein, not sleeping\nenough, phoning in your workouts, or doing too much cardio. Take heart,\nthough, because you’ll quickly gain back any muscle and strength you lost\nonce you come out of the calorie deficit.\nYou may also find that you miss reps more often while cutting, espe-\ncially toward the end of the cut. This is normal, and the solution is to reduce\nyour estimated one-rep maxes as described in chapter eighteen.\nQ: How should I coordinate my cuts and lean bulks and macrocycles?\nA: You can cut and lean bulk as desired, regardless of where you are in\na macrocycle, but if you’re so inclined, you can also incorporate “nutritional\nperiodization” into your regimen.\nHere are three tips on how to do this fruitfully:\n1. Start a cutting or lean bulking phase at the beginning of a mesocy-\ncle, and try not to switch while in the middle of it.\n2. Lean bulk for three to four mesocycles in a row before cutting.\nIdeally, you’d finish an entire macrocycle in a calorie surplus (four\nmesocycles), but if you eat too much during your lean bulk (tisk\ntisk), you can end after three mesocycles.\n3. For the best results, aim to spend at least two-thirds of the year\nlean bulking and no more than one-third cutting. Some experts\nrecommend maintaining a 4:1 ratio of time spent lean bulking to\ncutting.

Can I follow this program?\nA: Yes, but it’ll require some forethought.\nFirst, booking hotels close to adequate gyms helps a lot (hotel gyms usually\nsuck), and determining beforehand when you’ll work out is also a good idea.\nSecond, you have three options for your diet:\nFrequently Asked Questions 297\n1. Make a meal plan of simple foods you can pick up at a local grocery\nstore and prepare and store in your hotel room. Good choices\ninclude salad, deli meat, rotisserie chicken, fruit, nuts, high-pro-\ntein yogurt, granola, and the like. A grocery delivery service like\nInstacart or Amazon Prime Now can make this more convenient\n(if the hotel will accept the delivery for you).\n2. Track food intake on the go with an app like MyFitnessPal.\n3. Eat according to your appetite and try to keep your calories and\nmacros in check.\nIf you travel a lot and want to make good progress in your training,\noptions one and two are your best bets. Option three works fine for the\noccasional short trip, but not for regular travelers.\nQ: I’m not getting very sore. Is that a problem?\nA: I used to think perpetual muscle soreness was a price you had to\npay to get bigger—a badge of honor, if you will. (“Damn straight I have to\nwalk down stairs backward! My legs will be huge!”)\nI assumed a major reason we trained our muscles was to damage them,\nwhich resulted in soreness. Therefore, considerable soreness meant\nconsiderable damage that would hopefully lead to considerable muscle\ngrowth, right? Not quite.\nResearch shows that muscle damage may contribute to growth, but\nit isn’t a requirement.8 Workouts that produce large amounts of muscle\nsoreness may not result in muscle growth, and workouts that produce very\nlittle soreness can cause significant growth.9\nFor instance, an hour of downhill running can produce a tremendous\namount of muscle soreness in your legs, but it won’t do much toward"

If you\nfollow the Beyond Bigger Leaner Stronger program as it’s laid out, though,\nthis shouldn’t happen.\nQ: Should I exercise when I’m sick?\nA: No. At least not intensely.\nI understand the desire to train when sick. Once you’ve established a good\nworkout routine, skipping days can be harder than going to the gym even when\nyou’re not feeling well.

Force yourself to rest, though, because your normal\nFrequently Asked Questions 299\nworkouts will only make things worse and depress immune function.15\nThat said, animal research shows that light exercise while infected with\nthe influenza virus boosts immunity and speeds recovery.16 Similar effects\nhave been seen in human studies as well.17\nHuman research has also found that light exercise doesn’t impair the\nimmune system or prolong or worsen infections.18\nSo if you do any exercise while under the weather, make it twenty\nminutes or less of light cardio, like walking.\nQ: I only have dumbbells.

However, the importance of feeling good\nand confident about oneself ultimately outweighs physical\nfactors. Staying in shape enhances overall well-being and\nself-perception, which can lead to positive relationship\noutcomes.\nScan to Download\nExample\nKey Point:The Importance of Caloric Imbalance\nExample:You may find that even with the latest diet fad\npromising quick results, the crucial factor that truly\ninfluences your weight loss journey is the balance\nbetween the calories you consume and those you\nexpend. Imagine enjoying a delicious meal at a favorite\nrestaurant but then taking a brisk walk afterward to burn\noff those extra calories. This balance is vital: for every\nindulgence, offsetting it with activity ensures you're on\nthe right path to achieving your fitness goals.\nSSccaann ttoo DDoowwnnllooaadd\nCritical Thinking\nKey Point:The concept of dietary and exercise\nconfusion dominates modern fitness discourse.\nCritical Interpretation:The author argues that the\nmultitude of conflicting diet and exercise regimens\nposes a significant challenge for individuals seeking\neffective strategies for weight loss and muscle gain.\nHowever, readers should critically assess this view,\nrecognizing that the emphasis on caloric imbalance and\nprogressive overload may not account for personal\nhealth conditions, metabolic differences, or\npsychological factors influencing one's ability to adhere\nto a specific approach.

Main\nmeals are labeled A, B, and C, making them flexible in terms\nof consumption order. Snacks are also interchangeable.\nGuidelines for Fats\nEach main meal assumes the addition of some fat, such as\noils or dressings. Fish-oil supplements are not included in the\ncalculations, as they are optional.\nFluid Intake\nDrink 16 to 32 ounces of non-caloric fluids daily, along with\nSSccaann ttoo DDoowwnnllooaadd\nadditional intake around exercise. Coffee, tea, and diet sodas\ncontribute to this goal.\nVariety: Alan’s Rule of Two\nAim to include at least two different foods from six food\ngroups in meals. This promotes a broader range of vitamins\nand minerals, especially with fruits and vegetables.\nTiming Meals around Workouts\nIdeally, workouts should occur between two main meals,\nensuring protein availability for muscles. Morning exercisers\nmay train on an empty stomach but should consume a\npost-workout meal promptly.\nMeasuring Vs. Ballparking\nLife's unpredictability means precise meals may not always\nbe possible.

For instance, one camp may argue that\ncalories don't matter, while another emphasizes the\nneed to avoid carbs altogether. This leads to\nconfusion about what constitutes an effective and\nhealthy diet.\n2.Question\nHow does the author suggest you could create a caloric\ndeficit for weight loss?\nAnswer:The author explains that creating a caloric deficit\ninvolves finding a systematic way to reduce your food intake\nSSccaann ttoo DDoowwnnllooaadd\nwhile potentially increasing physical activity. This can be\nachieved by avoiding high-calorie foods, eating more protein,\nor consuming more fiber-rich vegetables, all of which help\nyou feel fuller faster and longer.\n3.Question\nWhat is the primary principle outlined for muscle\nbuilding according to the chapter?\nAnswer:The primary principle for building muscle is that in\norder to grow muscle mass, you must increase strength\nthrough progressive overload, which means gradually\nmaking your muscles work harder over time.\n4.Question\nWhat does the author mean by stating 'Everybody is\nright' in relation to diet and exercise groups?\nAnswer:The author asserts that despite the seemingly\ncontradictory dietary approaches, they all ultimately agree on\ntwo key points: 1) To lose weight, you must create an\nimbalance with fewer calories consumed than burned. 2) To\nbuild muscle, you need to get stronger.\nSSccaann ttoo DDoowwnnllooaadd\n5.Question\nHow do ancient human dietary practices relate to modern\ndiets according to the text?\nAnswer:The text discusses how ancient humans had varied\ndiets based on"

For instance, low-carb diets echo the food scarcity of\nancient times, whereas modern diets can include a wider\nvariety of foods, including grains and dairy, which were not\navailable to early humans.\n6.Question\nWhat evidence suggests that women may be attracted to\ncertain male body types?\nAnswer:Research indicates that women often find a V-shaped\ntorso—broad shoulders and a narrower waist—attractive,\ncorrelating with perceptions of health and reproductive\nsuitability. However, the overall attractiveness also depends\non context and personality traits.\n7.Question\nWhat is the best reason to get in shape according to the\nchapter?\nSSccaann ttoo DDoowwnnllooaadd\nAnswer:The best reason to pursue fitness and a healthy\nlifestyle is the positive impact it has on your self-perception.\nLooking better can translate into feeling better and boost\nyour confidence, which can lead to improved social\ninteractions and first impressions.\nChapter 2 | What Makes a Diet Work| Q&A\n1.Question\nWhy do diets that eliminate certain foods often fail in the\nlong term?\nAnswer:Diets often fail because they demonize\ncertain foods or whole macronutrients, making them\ntoo restrictive. When people feel deprived, they are\nless likely to stick with the diet for the long term,\nleading to eventual relapse to previous eating habits.\n2.Question\nWhat is the key to maintaining a successful diet?\nAnswer:The key to maintaining a successful diet is\nadherence. Finding a balance between foods you enjoy and\nnutritious options is essential for long-term sustainability.\nSSccaann ttoo DDoowwnnllooaadd\n3.Question\nHow does personal preference influence diet success?\nAnswer:Personal preference plays a crucial role in diet\nsuccess.

In terms of muscle gain, novices can expect\nto gain 2 to 3 pounds per month, intermediates 1 to 2 pounds\nper month, and advanced lifters ½ pound per month. These\ninsights highlight realistic timelines and the varying rates of\nprogress based on one's starting point.\n5.Question\nHow does the concept of nonlinear carbohydrate\nconsumption help manage energy levels during a dieting\nphase?\nSSccaann ttoo DDoowwnnllooaadd\nAnswer:Nonlinear carbohydrate consumption allows for a\nhigher intake of carbs on training days, which can help\nsustain energy during workouts. This strategy can prevent\nfeelings of deprivation and enhances performance while\naiding recovery. On non-training days, a lower carb intake\ncan help manage overall caloric balance and facilitate fat\nloss.\n6.Question\nWhy might a beginner like 'Skinny-Fat Stan' experience\nsimultaneous fat loss and muscle gain?\nAnswer:As a beginner, Stan's body is highly responsive to\nresistance training, meaning he can experience muscle\nhypertrophy while losing fat due to the new stimulus\nprovided by weight training. This unique ability, often\nreferred to as 'newbie gains,' occurs because his body is\nadapting to the stress of a new exercise program, allowing for\nbody recomposition.\n7.Question\nWhat are some common pitfalls in the weight loss journey\nthat can undermine long-term success?\nSSccaann ttoo DDoowwnnllooaadd\nAnswer:Common pitfalls include starting without a specific\nTBW, following overly restrictive diets that lead to cravings\nand adherence issues, and having unrealistic expectations of\nquick results.

Proper alignment\nprevents strain while maximizing muscle engagement,\ndriving performance and strength gains.\n5.Question\nHow do you modify a pushup to increase its intensity?\nSSccaann ttoo DDoowwnnllooaadd\nAnswer:To increase the intensity of a pushup, you can\nelevate your feet, add weight (like a vest), change hand\npositions (closer together for triceps emphasis), perform on\nunstable surfaces (such as balls or bands for added core\nchallenge), or stagger hand placement to engage muscles\ndifferently.\n6.Question\nWhat are effective variations for targeting the triceps in\nstrength training?\nAnswer:Effective triceps variations include cable overhead\nextensions, where you push a high pulley rope down with a\nsplit stance, and dumbbell prone tricep extensions, where you\nlie on a bench and lower the weights behind your head.\nThese help improve triceps strength during pressing\nmovements.\n7.Question\nWhy are exercises like parallel-bar dips considered risky?\nAnswer:Parallel-bar dips put stress on the shoulders by\nforcing them into a vulnerable position when pushing heavy\nSSccaann ttoo DDoowwnnllooaadd\nweights behind the body. For those not conditioned like\ngymnasts, this risk can lead to injury, outweighing potential\nbenefits.\n8.Question\nWhat mistakes should be avoided when incorporating\nbicep curls in a workout routine?\nAnswer:Avoid focusing solely on bicep curls without\ncontext—they should complement a balanced workout. Don't\noverdo isolation exercises for biceps to the detriment of\nlarger muscle groups, and ensure the use of correct form to\nprevent joint strain.\n9.Question\nWhat role do complementary and accessory exercises\nplay in a training regimen?\nAnswer:Complementary and accessory"

After that, adjust your fat and carbs\naccordingly. It’s important to understand food types\nand their calorie content. For example, a cup of\nstarches is around 200 calories whether it's pasta,\nrice, or beans. Use this understanding to maintain a\nbalance in your meals.\n2.Question\nWhy do the templates for calorie intake feel restrictive?\nSSccaann ttoo DDoowwnnllooaadd\nAnswer:The templates act as a guide to help learners\nunderstand appropriate food portions and nutrient ratios.\nThey can help build necessary knowledge and skills for\nsuccessful weight management. Although they provide\nstructure, they are not meant to restrict you permanently;\nthey can serve as a foundation for future meal planning and\nadjustments.\n3.Question\nHow long do the workouts in the program take to\ncomplete?\nAnswer:Although the program is designed for an experienced\nlifter to be completed in about 14 weeks, many people take\nlonger due to life interruptions such as work, vacations, or\nillness. Those breaks can actually be beneficial, allowing\nyour body to recover and gain strength.\n4.Question\nIs it okay to repeat the workouts?\nAnswer:Absolutely!

        "text": ", they\nall relied largely on anecdote to make recommendations; none extensively delved\ninto the actual science of the topic. A more scientific approach was clearly needed for\nthe masses. In 2016, my vision became reality with publication of the first edition\nof Science and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy.\nMuch has transpired since the release of the book’s first edition. For one, research\non muscle hypertrophy has skyrocketed. Thousands of new studies have been pub-\nlished, helping to further our understanding as to what makes muscle grow and\nhow to best go about optimizing muscle development. Moreover, feedback and the\nperspective of time have allowed me to see ways in which the original text could\nbe improved and expanded. Ultimately, I determined that a revision of the original\ntext was warranted.\nI am thrilled to present the second edition of Science and Development of Muscle\nHypertrophy. The text has been completely updated, with inclusion of more than\n30% new content. In addition to containing extensive discussion of new research\nfindings and their practical implications to muscle building, I have added two new\nchapters of importance: one that delves into the methods employed to measure\nmuscle growth and another that evaluates various advanced training practices\ncommonly employed to enhance hypertrophy. Further, 10 new sidebars highlight\nspecific topics of interest to gaining lean mass.\nA few words of note about the book in general: While the writing is geared toward\nmaster’s level students in exercise-related disciplines, the majority of the text should\nbe accessible to anyone with a fundamental understanding of the principles of\nexercise science. The first two chapters are the most scientifically technical, and will\nrequire some background in exercise physiology and biomechanics to fully appre-\nciate the complexities and challenges faced when attempting to draw inferences as\nto the underlying mechanisms of what drives hypertrophic adaptations. However,\neven if you do not possess a strong scientific background, much information can\nbe gleaned from at least reading through these chapters to familiarize yourself with\nbasic concepts and terminology.\nDespite its scientific basis, the overall focus of the book is on the applied aspects\nof muscle development. As such, each chapter contains “key points” that summarize\ntake-home messages and their practical applications. There also is an entire chapter\n(chapter 8) devoted to synthesizing the literature in an evidence-based fashion to\ncreate customized hypertrophy-oriented programs"

The BFR technique combines light loads\n(20% to 50% of 1RM) with occlusion via pressure cuff to impede venous return\nwithout obstructing arterial inflow. Regular performance of BFR induces marked\nhypertrophy, often similar to what is observed with the use of heavy loads. Given the\nlight loads employed, it is hypothesized that BFR confers these hypertrophic benefits\nwhile minimizing disruption of myofibers. However, muscle damage is a known con-\nsequence of reperfusion subsequent to ischemia (72, 99). Takarada and colleagues\n(265) demonstrated that although markers of muscle damage were attenuated after\nBFR training, there was evidence of fine microdamage within myofibers, leaving\nopen the possibility that damage may have contributed to the results.

Thirty million people are estimated\nto take NSAIDS daily (15), and their use is especially widespread among those who\nparticipate in intense exercise programs (297).\nAn often-overlooked issue with NSAID consumption in combination with resistance\ntraining, however, is the potential interference with muscular adaptations.

Research findings generally are reported as the collective mean\n(i.e., average) of data obtained from a cohort of subjects. However, there will be a\nvariance in responses across different subjects, the extent of which is exhibited as\nthe standard deviation of the data. Sometimes these variances can be quite large.\nHence, simply taking the mean at face value does not necessarily reflect the results\na given person can expect to see.\nIn the case of body composition testing, a given method of assessment can\nproduce a wide range of values in lean mass changes, both positive and negative,\nand end up showing no mean change. However, from a mean statistical standpoint,\nthe findings can be virtually identical to another assessment tool showing a much\nnarrower range of values that hover around the zero mark. These issues have been\ndemonstrated in numerous validation studies for hypertrophy assessments. For\nexample, ADP and hydrodensitometry were found to be interchangeable with the\n4C model for quantifying group changes in fat-free mass when using a diet-induced\nweight loss program; however, large differences were seen on an individual level,\nleading the authors to conclude: “as indicated by the wide limits of agreement . . .\nindividual estimates of changes in body composition when taken alone should be\ninterpreted with caution” (55). Similarly, a study that investigated agreement between\n4C, 3C, and 2C models found all three methods gave acceptable group mean values,\nbut on an individual level, only the 3C model served as a valid alternative to 4C (89).\nGroup versus individual discrepancies also may apply to sources of error associated\nwith a given assessment tool.

Low-load training emphasizes\nmetabolic stress and promotes the greatest increases in local muscular endur-\nance, whereas low-repetition, high-load training requires high levels of mechanical\ntension and enhances the ability to lift heavier loads as a result of greater neural\nadaptations. Some evidence suggests there may be a fiber type–specific response\nin which heavy-load training produces greater cross-sectional area increases in Type\nII fibers, and light loads have a preferential effect on Type I hypertrophy. Thus, if the\nprimary goal is maximizing hypertrophy without regard to strength-related factors,\nthen training across a wide spectrum of repetition ranges (1 through 20+) is recom-\nmended to exploit all possible avenues for the complete development of the whole\nmuscle. There is merit to focusing on a medium-repetition range (6RM to 12RM)\nbecause it provides high levels of mechanical tension sufficient to stimulate the\nfull array of fiber types while allowing for sufficient training volumes.

Research is limited on the topic,\nmaking it difficult to draw concrete conclusions. Concentric tempos of 1 to 3 seconds\ncan be considered viable options; an eccentric tempo of at least 2 seconds appears\nnecessary to ensure loads are lowered under muscular control. On the other hand,\ntraining at very slow volitional durations (>10 seconds per repetition) appears to\nproduce inferior increases in muscle growth, although a lack of controlled studies\non the topic makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. It is conceivable that\ncombining different repetition durations could enhance the hypertrophic response\nto resistance training, although this hypothesis requires further study.\nDeveloping a strong mind–muscle connection is perhaps the most important\nconsideration in regard to repetition duration. By focusing on actively contracting the\ntarget muscle throughout the range of motion of a given exercise, maximal mechan-\nical forces are directed to the musculature, heightening the degree of stimulation.\nTABLE 4.7 Summary of Hypertrophy Training Studies Investigating Repetition Duration\nRepetition Study Load Hypertrophy\nStudy Subjects Design duration duration matched? measurement Findings\nCarlson et 59 trained Random assignment 6 seconds vs. 10 weeks Yes BodPod No significant\nal.

TUT can be operationally defined as the total amount of time that a\nmuscle, or group of muscles, endures mechanical stress during resistance exercise.\nAnecdotally, some fitness professionals have put forth the claim that sets should\nhave a TUT of 40 to 60 seconds to optimally build muscle.\nResearch into the role of TUT in muscle development is limited. In one of the few\nstudies that attempted to directly investigate the topic, Burd and colleagues (32) car-\nried out an acute, within-subject design in which subjects performed a leg extension\nexercise at 30% of 1RM with a slow tempo (6-0-6) with one leg and trained the other\nleg at the same intensity of load with a fast tempo (1-0-1). Three sets were performed\nfor each condition with a 2-minute rest interval between sets, resulting in a 6-fold\ngreater TUT in the slow-tempo condition. Post-exercise muscle biopsies showed sig-\nnificantly greater increases in myofibrillar protein synthesis and intracellular anabolic\nsignaling favoring the slow-tempo condition; differences primarily manifested 24 to\n30 hours after the training bout.

        "text": " slow-tempo condition; differences primarily manifested 24 to\n30 hours after the training bout. While on the surface these findings seemingly sup-\nport the importance of TUT as a driver of hypertrophy, conclusions were confounded\nby the fact that people in the slow-tempo condition performed all sets to volitional\nfailure while the number of repetitions performed for the fast-tempo condition were\nmatched to that of the slow-tempo condition. Thus, rather than providing insights into\nthe hypertrophic effects of TUT, the results reinforce the importance of challenging\nthe muscles with a high level of effort for muscle building.\nStudies comparing superslow training to traditional training whereby both condi-\ntions are performed to volitional fatigue have not shown a benefit from higher TUTs; in\nfact, evidence indicates training in a traditional fashion produces superior hypertrophy\ndespite a substantially lower TUT (221). A caveat to these findings is that the higher\nTUT in the superslow condition was at the expense of a much lower intensity of load.\nHow these variables interact with one another to affect muscle growth is not clear.\nDespite the paucity of objective evidence, a logical case can be made that TUT\ndoes play a role in hypertrophy. However, it appears the effects are more related\nto the time a muscle is worked over the duration of a training session than to the\nTUT for a given set. In support of this hypothesis, my lab showed that performing a\npowerlifting-style workout consisting of 7 sets of 3RM produced increases in muscle\ngrowth similar to those of a bodybuilding-style workout consisting of 3 sets of 10RM\n(208). Although TUT in the powerlifting-style sets was markedly lower than in the\nbodybuilding-style sets (~9 seconds vs. ~30 seconds, respectively), the total TUT\nfor the training session was approximately equal because of the greater number of\nsets performed for the powerlifting-style condition. These findings are in contrast to\na follow-up study showing that when the total number of sets were equated, a body-\nbuilding-style workout (10RM) elicited greater hypertrophic adaptations compared to\na powerlifting-style workout (3RM) (213). Here, the TUT was markedly greater both\nduring each set as well as over the course of the training session.\nIt also can be hypothesized that not all repetitions equally contribute to hyper-\ntrophy.

For example, the initial repetitions in a set of 25RM are relatively easy to\n122\nRole of Resistance Training Variables in Hypertrophy\nexecute; only when fatigue begins to manifest does the set become challenging. In\ncontrast, the initial repetitions during a 6RM set are substantially more challenging\nto complete from the outset, and conceivably would promote greater anabolic stim-\nulation. A case therefore can be made that the TUT in the 6RM protocol would have\ngreater hypertrophic relevance than that of the higher-repetition set. Hence, to some\nextent TUT should be considered in the context of the repetition range in which a\nset is performed and the corresponding duration of repetitions that are challenging\nto complete.\nAnother inherent issue with TUT is that it considers the duration of the repetitions\nas a whole and thus neglects to take into account the individual portion of the actions.\nFor example, a set carried out at a 4-0-1 tempo (4-second concentric actions, 1-second\neccentric actions) would have the same TUT as a set carried out at a 1-0-4 tempo\n(1-second concentric actions, 4-second eccentric actions), provided the number of\nrepetitions is equated between sets. This has potentially important implications given\nthe research that shows differential intracellular signaling and hypertrophy responses\n(72) between concentric and eccentric actions.\nAll things considered, evidence indicates that TUT plays a role in muscle hypertro-\nphy. However, its implications must be considered in the context of the resistance\ntraining variables comprising a given routine (i.e., repetition range, tempo of eccentric\nversus concentric actions). Within limits, it appears that the total TUT accumulated\nfor a muscle group in a given session, or perhaps over time (e.g., weekly), has the\nmost relevance from a muscle growth standpoint. A rationale for speculation exists\nwhereby a longer TUT (>60 seconds per set) may be beneficial for targeting hyper-\ntrophy of Type I muscle fibers; this hypothesis warrants further exploration.\nExercise Order Despite wide acceptance that exercise order\nshould proceed from large- to small-muscle\nCurrent resistance"

A range of 10 to 20 sets per muscle is a general guideline\nfor weekly volume prescription. That said, there is a fairly wide interindividual\nresponse to the volume dose, and thus some people will thrive on somewhat\nlower volumes, while others will benefit from slightly higher volumes. Strate-\ngic use of very high volumes (~30+ sets per muscle) can be employed to help\nbring up lagging muscle groups. To avoid overtraining, overall volume should\nbe progressively increased over the course of a training cycle; periods of reduced\ntraining volume should be integrated regularly to facilitate the recovery process.\n• When employing lower total volumes, training frequency does not seem to play\nmuch if any role in muscle growth. In these cases, individuals can choose the\nfrequency that best fits their schedule and goals. Alternatively, when moderate\nto higher volumes are performed (>10 sets per muscle per week), higher training\nfrequencies (at least twice per week) allow for better volume management, thus\nfacilitating greater muscular adaptations. Although both total-body and split\nroutines can be viable training strategies, splitting workouts by body region or\nfunction (e.g., upper and lower, pushing and pulling) may be superior when\ntraining with higher volumes because it allows for higher weekly frequencies (and\nthus shorter sessions) while affording greater muscular recuperation between\nworkouts.\n• Training across a wide spectrum of repetition ranges (1 to 20+) is recommended\nto ensure complete whole-muscle development.

This should include the\nliberal use of free-form (i.e., free weights and cables) and machine-based exer-\ncises. Similarly, both multi- and single-joint exercises should be included in a\nhypertrophy-specific routine to maximize muscular growth.\n• Both concentric and eccentric actions should be incorporated during training.\nEvidence of the benefits of combining isometric actions with dynamic actions\nis lacking at this time. The addition of supramaximal eccentric loading may\nenhance the hypertrophic response.\n• An optimal rest interval for hypertrophy training does not appear to exist.\nResearch indicates that resting at least 2 minutes between sets provides a hyper-\ntrophic advantage over resting for shorter periods, at least when performing\nmulti-joint free weight exercises. It may be beneficial to employ rest intervals of\napproximately 60 to 90 seconds for single-joint and perhaps certain machine-\nbased exercises because these movements do not show a reduction in volume\nload from shorter rest, and the heightened metabolic stress may confer additional\nanabolic advantages.\n• Current evidence suggests little difference in muscle hypertrophy when training\nwith isotonic repetition durations ranging from 0.5 to 6 seconds to muscular\nfailure. Thus, a fairly wide range of repetition durations can be employed if the\n134\nRole of Resistance Training Variables in Hypertrophy\nprimary goal is to maximize muscle growth.

While mild DOMS generally is benign from a performance\nstandpoint, moderate to severe levels of soreness can impair subsequent strength\ncapacity, thereby potentially having a detrimental impact on muscular adaptations.\nNumerous strategies have been proposed to help alleviate the negative conse-\nquences of DOMS (15).

Interestingly, evidence did not show a beneficial effect of stretching on DOMS,\ndespite its popular use as a primary treatment.\nRecently, foam rolling has been advocated for counteracting DOMS.

It that facilitate remodeling and rejuvenation.\nTAKE-HOME POINTS\n• There is a large genetic component in the individual hypertrophic response. A\nwide array of genes have been identified as playing a role in the ability to gain\nmuscle. It is likely that interactions of multiple genetic loci ultimately determine\na person’s genetic potential to gain muscle. Hereditary differences in muscle\nmorphology also are believed to govern the extent of a person’s muscle-building\ncapacity. Although the terms responders and nonresponders have been discussed\nin the literature, these classifications are overly simplistic; virtually everyone can\nincrease muscle mass above baseline levels with consistent resistance training over\ntime, but the ultimate extent of hypertrophy will vary greatly between individuals.\n• Biological aging has a marked effect on muscle mass. Peak mass is achieved\nbetween the third and fifth decades of life, after which a gradual, progressive\nloss of muscle ensues (i.e., sarcopenia). An age-related reduction in anabolic\nhormones and satellite cell function are believed to be largely responsible for\nsarcopenic changes. Chronic low-grade inflammation also appears to play a role\nin the process. Regular resistance exercise can help abate age-related muscle loss\nand even produce hypertrophic increases above that in sedentary younger people.\nHowever, hypertrophic potential diminishes with advancing age, and evidence\nindicates that elderly people need a greater weekly minimum training dose to\nmaintain muscle once they have achieved a given level of hypertrophy.\n• The ability to build muscle differs between the sexes. Although women attain\napproximately equal relative muscle growth compared to men following regi-\nmented resistance training, men gain significantly more muscle on an absolute\nbasis. These differences are seemingly attributed, at least in part, to variances in\ncirculating testosterone. Women tend to experience a greater age-related muscle\nloss than men, conceivably mediated by postmenopausal reductions in estrogen\nlevels.\n• Hypertrophic capacity progressively diminishes as people become more trained.\nThis is attributed to a"

        "text": "YPERTROPHY\nAttentional focus is a well-recognized aspect of motor learning and its use has impor-\ntant implications for muscular hypertrophy. Operationally defined from a resistance\ntraining standpoint, attentional focus refers to what a person thinks about during\neach repetition. Two primary types of attentional focus have been recognized in the\nliterature: internal and external. An internal focus involves thinking about bodily\nmovements during performance, whereas an external focus involves thinking about\nthe outcomes of movements.\nThe majority of research supports adopting an external focus of attention when\ncarrying out performance-oriented tasks. A recent comprehensive review of the\nliterature found superior effects from using an external versus an internal focus in\nmore than 90% of studies that examined performance-oriented outcomes (151).\nThe performance-based superiority of an external focus during resistance training is\nthought to be due to an enhanced economy of movement associated with greater\nforce production and reduced muscular activity compared to an internal focus (con-\nstrained action hypothesis) (86). It is important to note, however, that improvements\nin performance-related measures do not necessarily equate to maximal increases in\nmuscle hypertrophy. A case can be made that an internal focus is a better approach\nwhen the goal is to maximize muscle development.\nEmploying a hypertrophy-oriented internal focus of attention is consistent with the\nlong-standing bodybuilding axiom of developing a mind–muscle connection. Simply\nstated, this strategy involves visualizing the target muscle during the course of a\nlift and willfully directing neural drive to that muscle. When properly executed, the\napproach theoretically allows for increased stimulation of the target muscle while\nreducing the involvement of other synergists.\nIndirect evidence lends support to a hypertrophic benefit when using an internal\nfocus. Numerous studies have found that activation of a given muscle is enhanced\nby using an internal focus of attention.

A follow-up study by the same lab showed that the pectoralis major and\ntriceps could be individually targeted after subjects were instructed to visualize those\nmuscles during performance of the bench press at 50% of 1RM (128). Interestingly,\nthe magnitude of the effect was substantially reduced when the load was increased\nto 80% of 1RM. This may be due to increased force demands when training with\nheavier loads, thereby altering the ability to focus on the muscle being worked in\nfavor of simply lifting the load. The implication is that the hypertrophy-related benefits\nof using an internal focus may be attenuated or annulled when training with very\nheavy loads. That said, the ability to increase muscle activation through an internal\nfocus has been shown in other muscles as well, including the abdominals (20, 35,\n68), gluteus maximus (81), and elbow flexors (86, 137). The findings provide a strong\nrationale for using an internal focus to target a given muscle.\nThe logical question is whether increasing activation of a muscle translates into\ngreater muscle growth. Although research on the topic remains limited, some evi-\ndence suggests that this is indeed the case. Wakahara and colleagues (138) carried\nout a two-part experiment to investigate the topic. In the first part of the experiment,\nmuscle activation was assessed by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging during\n5 sets of 8 repetitions of the lying triceps extension in 12 untrained men. The results\nshowed that activation of the triceps brachii was significantly higher in the proximal\nand middle aspects of the muscle versus the distal portion. In the second part of the\nstudy, 12 additional subjects performed the same routine used in part 1 of the study\nfor 3 days per week over 12 weeks. At the study’s conclusion, increases in muscle\ncross-sectional area corresponded to the specific regions most activated during\nexercise performance. A follow-up study by the same lab reported similar findings\nusing alternative exercises for the triceps brachii (139).

After 8 weeks, the internal focus group showed significantly greater\nincreases in elbow flexor thickness compared to those adopting an external focus\n(12.4% vs. 6.9%, respectively). Alternatively, both groups achieved similar increases\nin quadriceps growth. Although speculative, discrepancies between muscle groups\nmay be attributed to the fact that most people find it easier to develop a mind–muscle\nconnection in the upper extremities because the arms are used for actions that\nrequire dexterity and thus more brain-coordinated fine motor control. On the other\nhand, the lower body is used primarily for ambulation, and these gross movement\npatterns require less conscious thought to carry out.\nIn totality, the findings of increased muscle activation combined with those showing\nsite-specific hypertrophy in the region of activation seem to suggest that an internal\nattentional focus is the best approach for maximizing muscle development. The only\nstudy to date that directly investigated the topic provides further support for such an\napproach. Although many gym-derived tenets of bodybuilding are of questionable\npractice, claims of the hypertrophic benefit of developing a mind–muscle connection\nand employing it during exercise performance seem to have merit.\n182\nProgram Design for Maximal Hypertrophy\nExercise Selection KEY POINT\nStrategies Maximal hypertrophy can be best achieved\nby systematically varying the exercises per-\nSelecting the appropriate exercises is an formed and fully working all aspects of the\nimportant factor for maximizing whole-body targeted musculature, varying the angles\nmuscle hypertrophy.

However, a conundrum arises when\ndeciding how to account for volume during multi-joint versus single-joint exercise.\nIn these movements, working muscles can act as agonists (a prime mover in carry-\ning out the exercise), synergists (a secondary mover that contracts simultaneously\nwith the prime mover in performance), or stabilizers that contract isometrically to\nmaintain postural stability.\nA recent meta-analysis on the topic gave equal weight to both agonists and syner-\ngists when calculating volume during multi-joint exercise (119).

The approach was justified by find-\nings of a recent review that concluded the performance of multi-joint and single-joint\nexercises produces similar increases in muscle size (54).\nHowever, while it is clear that multi-joint exercise can promote significant hyper-\ntrophy in the synergists, the extent of their stimulation during these movements\nremains questionable. Muscle activation is influenced by a variety of biomechanical\nfactors, including the length–tension relationship, muscle moment arms, and motor\nabundance (i.e., the body’s attempt to determine a unique solution to efficiently\nperform a complex motor task). The interplay of these variables is complex, varying\nbetween exercises and, to some extent, individuals. However, taking into account\n(continued)\n183\nScience and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy\nHow to Calculate Volume in Multi- Versus Single-Joint Exercises (continued)\nthe ability to alter these various biomechanical factors to more favorably work a given\nmuscle or segment of a muscle (see the biomechanics section in this chapter for a\nmore detailed discussion), it seems logical that single-joint exercise can potentially\nelicit greater hypertrophy for certain muscles compared to multi-joint movements,\nat least in certain exercises and under certain conditions.\nNumerous electromyographic (EMG) studies report differences in muscle activa-\ntion between multi-joint and single-joint exercise. For example, single-joint exercises\ntargeting the hamstrings (e.g., leg curl, stiff-leg deadlift) display significantly greater\nEMG amplitudes than multi-joint lower-body exercise (e.g., squat, leg press) (5, 150).\nWith respect to the quadriceps, studies show higher EMG amplitudes for the rectus\nfemoris during single-joint knee extension exercise versus multi-joint exercises\nsuch as the barbell squat and leg press (5, 44). Discrepancies in muscle activation\nbetween muscles during multi-joint exercises have been shown for the upper-body\nmusculature and provide further insights on the topic.

It\nis important to note that although some evidence indicates a correlation between\nmuscle activation and increases in hypertrophy (138-140), causality cannot be inferred\nfrom correlational data, and the efficacy of EMG in predicting future hypertrophic\nchanges remains undetermined.\nLongitudinal research on the topic remains somewhat equivocal; some studies\ndemonstrate a potential superiority of single-joint compared to multi-joint exercise\n(12, 13, 85), and others show no apparent differences (11, 14, 37, 52, 53).

It is considered important to human physiology and\ncognition, and thus has relevance to recovery from exercise. Three primary factors\ndetermine the recuperative outcome of sleep: the duration (total sleep time), qual-\nity, and phase (circadian timing) of sleep (109). Research indicates that disruptions\nin sleep-related factors can have a negative impact on exercise performance (50).\nHowever, the impact of sleep on muscle hypertrophy has received less attention.\nA recent review of literature concluded that shiftwork, which tends to disrupt sleep\npatterns, is associated with a negative influence on skeletal muscle health, including\na decrease in muscle protein synthesis and elevations in proteolysis (2). However,\nthese workers also experience alterations in other lifestyle factors such as exposure\nto natural and artificial light, as well as nutritional intake. Decreased sleep quality\nalso is a symptom of overtraining syndrome, leading to speculation that dysregulated\nsleep patterns may be a trigger for overtraining (25). But again, multiple other factors\nare purportedly involved in the condition as well (e.g., increased duration of work or\nstudy; decreased calorie, carbohydrate, and protein intakes; worsened mood states;\nand decreased hydration), thereby confounding the ability to draw strong conclusions\nabout the specific role of sleep.\nSeveral observational studies have shown an association between poor sleep and\nlow levels of lean mass (21, 71, 135), although these findings are not universal (101).\nOther observational research indicates that effects of short sleep duration may be\nsex specific, with greater detriments on"

Interestingly, evi-\ndence also shows that excessive sleep duration correlates with lower lean mass (70,\n135), suggesting there may be a sweet spot for optimizing muscle growth. However,\nwhile these studies provide intriguing evidence on the topic, they are correlational\nin nature and thus cannot be used to draw causality.\nControlled research investigating the effects of sleep deprivation in combination\nwith regular resistance training on muscle hypertrophy is scant. An 8-week rodent\nstudy (93) randomized rats to one of five conditions: (1) control, (2) sleep deprived,\n(3) resistance trained, (4) sham (trained on the apparatus without load), or (5) resist-\nance trained and sleep deprived. Sleep deprivation consisted of placing animals on\na platform in a stainless-steel reservoir filled with water up to 1 centimeter (0.4 inch)\nbelow the surface of the platforms; if an animal fell asleep, it would make contact with\nthe water and thus be stirred to wake up. Sleep deprivation was carried out for 96\ncontinuous hours. Resistance training involved loaded stair climbing with resistance\nprogressively increased to continually challenge muscular abilities. Results showed\nthat while resistance training attenuated atrophy in sleep-deprived rodents, muscle\nmass only returned to baseline values; the resistance-trained group with normal sleep\nrealized substantially greater hypertrophic increases (~10%). Moreover, testosterone\nand IGF-1 levels were blunted, and cortisol levels were elevated in sleep-deprived\nanimals compared to those with normal sleep. Although the findings are intriguing, it\nshould be noted that the extent of sleep deprivation was severe (96 hours), and thus,\nfindings cannot be generalized to predict how restricted sleep (disrupted sleep–wake\ncycle), as commonly seen in human populations, affects hypertrophic adaptations.

Each method uses its own criteria for assessing protein quality,\nwhich is ultimately a function of a food’s essential amino acid composition and the\ndigestibility and bioavailability of its amino acids (122). For example, the CS method\nanalyzes the content of each essential amino acid in a food, which is then divided\nby the content of the same amino acid in egg protein (considered to have a CS of\n100). Somewhat similarly, the PDCAAS method is based on a comparison of the\nEAA content of a test protein with that of a reference EAA profile, but, as the name\nimplies, it also takes into account the effects of digestion. The PER method takes\na completely different approach; it measures weight gain in young rats that are fed\na test protein as compared to every gram of consumed protein. Alternatively, both\nthe BV and NPU methods are based on nitrogen balance: BV measures the nitrogen\nretained in the body and divides it by the total amount of nitrogen absorbed from\ndietary protein, whereas NPU simply compares the amount of protein consumed\nto the amount retained.\nGiven the inherent differences in the protein quality measured, the methods can\nresult in large discrepancies in the reported quality of protein-containing foods. Deter-\nmining which single method is the best is difficult, but a case can be made that the\nPDCAAS and BV methods are the most relevant to human growth because they take\nprotein digestibility into account. That said, because each method has drawbacks, the\nbest approach to assessing protein quality is to take multiple measures—particularly\nPDCAAS and BV—into account.\nRecently, a new protein scoring system—the digestible indispensable amino acid\nscore (DIAAS)—has been advocated as a superior approach to assessing protein\nquality. DIAAS is based on digestibility of protein in the ileum, which is believed\nto provide greater accuracy than current measures (108). Although DIAAS shows\npromise as replacement for PDCAAS and BV, many protein sources have yet to be\nexamined using this method (108), thus compromising its practicality.\nTABLE 9.3 Macronutrient Recommen- sugar molecules, respectively) or polysaccharides\ndations for Maximizing Hypertrophy (containing many sugar molecules).

        "text": " CAN THE BODY USE FOR\nMUSCLE-BUILDING IN A SINGLE MEAL?\nA common claim heard in fitness circles is that the body can absorb only 20 to 30 g\nof protein in a single feeding. This belief is often used in support of eating protein-rich\nmeals every few hours throughout the day. However, the veracity of such claims\nare dubious.\nFirst and foremost, it is important to differentiate the term absorption from utiliza-\ntion. From a nutritional standpoint, absorption refers to the passage of nutrients from\nthe gut into circulation. As such, there is virtually no limit to how much protein a person\ncan absorb from a given meal. After digestion, the protein’s constituent amino acids\ntraverse the intestinal wall and enter circulation where virtually all become available\nfor use at the tissue level. A potential issue occurs when a person ingests individual\nfree-form amino acids, which can bring about competition for transport through the\nenterocytes. In this case, amino acids present in the highest concentrations are\npreferentially absorbed at the expense of those in lesser concentrations (49).\nWith this information in mind, the more pertinent question is how much protein the\nbody can use from a single feeding to build muscle. This has important implications\nfor optimizing muscle development because amino acids not used are either oxidized\nfor energy or transaminated to form alternative bodily compounds (94).\nResearch by Areta and colleagues (7) indicates only a limited amount of protein\ncan be used at the tissue level. The study randomized subjects to perform 4 sets of\nleg extension exercise and then consume post-exercise protein at rest under the\nfollowing conditions: 8 servings of 10 g every 1.5 hours, 4 servings of 20 g every\n3 hours, or 2 servings of 40 g every 6 hours. Results showed that the 20 g dose\nhad the greatest effect on muscle protein synthesis over a 12-hour recovery period,\nsuggesting the upper threshold for use is less than 40 g. Although these results may\nseem compelling on the surface, several confounding variables must be considered\nwhen drawing practical inferences from the data. For one, the researchers used\nwhey as the protein source. Whey is a fast-acting protein. Its absorption rate is esti-\nmated to be approximately 10 g per hour (16).

In contrast, the absorption\nrate for cooked egg protein is approximately 3 g an hour (16), resulting in a much\nmore prolonged anabolic effect. Moreover, people most often consume protein\nin the context of whole foods that also contain combinations of carbohydrate and\nfat; the inclusion of these additional nutrients further slows absorption, allowing a\nmore time-released entry of the amino acids into circulation. Finally, subjects were\nyoung males with an average body weight of approximately 82 kg (181 lb); the total\nprotein intake of 80 g therefore was far below their daily requirement to maximize\nanabolism (approximately 130 to 180 g). In sum, each of these factors, alone or in\ncombination, may have unduly influenced findings and thus limit extrapolation to\nreal-world scenarios (126).\nA subsequent study by Macnaughton and colleagues (84) indicates that the type\nof exercise program also may have been a confounding variable.

Although a mechanistic rationale has yet to be determined for\nthe findings, it can be speculated that perhaps the body becomes more efficient at\nusing protein for tissue-building purposes when feeding is restricted within limited\ntime boundaries, sparing oxidation of amino acids.\nIn summary, there is little doubt that a threshold exists for how much protein an\nindividual can utilize in a given meal; beyond a certain dose, amino acids will be oxi-\ndized for energy rather than used for muscle building. However, evidence indicates\nthat the threshold appears to be higher than the common claim of 20 to 30 g in a\nsitting.
